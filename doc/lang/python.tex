\idx{Python}Script\idx{Script Language} language which wont bite too much. It won't do concurrency\footnote{Unless you \textsl{\textbf{really}} know what you are doing, and 95\% of those who think they do don't.}, syntax errors are produced at runtime, and it is numerically pretty slow. If you can accept this (e.g., if you are doing script work) it's a pretty good language.

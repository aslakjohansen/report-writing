\section{Make}

Make\idx{Make} is a general-purpose build system where build target and subtargets can be defined along with dependencies and recipes (sequences of commands) for building them. The general-purpose comes from it being able to run arbitrary commands and thus support build flows where parts of the codebase is autogenerated. For instance, it is a small matter to depine a build target with dependencies for each of the following steps:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Build some rust code for doing graph analysis.
  \item Run a python script that loads a graph from JSON, uses the rust code to produce some analysis, and dump the result into some C file.
  \item Build a C program that depends on that C file.
  \item Run that C program to produce an image.
  \item Run a command that generates a PDF from that image.
\end{itemize}

% dependency resolution
By analysing the dependency\idxx{Graph!Dependency}{Dependency graph}\index{Dependency graph} graph in the context of the timestamps of already built targets, it performs dependency\idx{Dependency resolution} resolution (i.e., comes up with a minimal build plan) and executes it. Make is by no means the only system that can do this. However, it is by far the simplest one to get started with.

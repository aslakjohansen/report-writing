% CISC vs RISC

\subsubsection{RISC-V}

\subsubsection{MIPS}

% intro: efficient, good for teaching, dead, mips has now gone risc-v

\subsubsection{ARM}

\subsubsection{x86-64}

% being a cics architecture there are many instructions, some are really old and basically dead (shouldn't be used), complex requirements (only work or is efficient on specific registers), no fun

\section{Deadlines}

At SDU there are a few deadlines to be concerned with. These are:

  \item The deadline for signing up for a 40 ECTS MSc project and is, naturally, only applicable to MSc projects. See section \ref{sec:projectsize} for details.
  \item The deadline of handing in the project description. Please note that this needs to be approved. See section \ref{sec:projectdesc} for details.
  \item The deadline of handing in the final report.
\end{itemize}

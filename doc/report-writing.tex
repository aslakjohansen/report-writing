%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% Introduction
\chapter{Introduction}

% purpose

\section{Supervisor}

First of all: All supervisors are different. If your supervisor disagrees with this section, then they are right and this section is wrong.

\subsection{Role}

% inclusion: report structure (when presented with text of reasonable quality)

% exclusion: basic grammar, spelling

\subsection{Interaction}

The perfect interaction model for supervision depends on the specific project. However, as a starting point I like to have a weekly recurring status meeting of 30 minutes that goes into the calendar. That way there is time allocated. If I don't receive an agenda over Discord 24 hours before the meeting I consider it canceled and may reallocate the time. In some weeks there won't be anything to cover in this status meeting, and in other weeks there may be a need for an extra meeting.

When it comes to the day-to-day supervision (aka the small questions and messages) I find that a per-project Discord channels works best. That setup also integrates well with online meetings and screensharing.

\subsection{Choice}

% intro: partnership
The relationship between the students of a group, their supervisor(s) is a partnership. Ideally, all partners should get something out of it. From the supervisors side that will usually be a domain or field of interest, and the project could be rooted in a research project.

% if it doesnt work out
If you have a negative previous experience with a potential supervisor (e.g., from a bachelor project), then you should obviously look elsewhere. Do note that this is does not have to indicate more that incompatibilities of personality types.

% reasons
Good reasons to choose a supervisor may include:
\begin{itemize}
  \item You like the supervisor on a personal level. Do note that supervision is not a personal relationship.
  \item You have enjoyed classes taught by the supervisor. Do note that supervision style may differ from teaching style.
  \item Overlap in technological interests.
  \item Overlap in domain interests.
\end{itemize}

\section{Project Size}
\label{sec:projectsize}

% project length
Currently, at SDU, a BSc project is 15 ECTS points across the spring semester, and a MSc project is either 30 ECTS across the spring semester or 40 ECTS points across two semesters starting in the fall. The workload of the 40 ECTS variant is distributed so that 10 ECTS points are placed in the fall semester and the remaining 30 ECTS points fill up the entire spring semester. When that model is followed, the fall semester is typically spent interviewing stakeholders, doing the literature review and generally laying things out so that everything is ready for a focused spring semester. If you have found a project that gets you excited, and you should, then I really recommend that you choose a 40 ECTS point MSc. The 30 ECTS points variant has a tendency to get crammed. Be aware that there is a deadline for applying for a 40 ECTS project.

\section{Group Composition}

% don't do it alone
Groups of one can work, but they rarely do. What usually happens is that -- lacking experience with a project of this size -- the student starts postponing tasks (e.g., due to waning motivation). Groups of two are much more robust in that sense, likely due to a combination of a feeling of responsibility towards the other group member and the shared support structure. Groups of three can also work, but here the trick becomes (i) to size to project workload, and (ii) to make it clear that all have done their fair share of the project.

% friends but not too good friends
It is important for group members to be on good terms. Positive experience from previous groupwork is a plus. However, groups consisting of too \textsl{good} friends have a tendency to find topics irrelevant to the project to spend their time on. While that is a healthy thing it is not conductive in terms of progressing the project.

\section{Project Choice}

\section{Industrial Collaboration}

% positive

% seen through the eyes of the company

% negative

\subsection{Non-Disclosure Agreement}

% purpose and involvement
Often, an industrial collaborator will insist on the anyone coming into contact with what they consider company secrets to sign a nondisclosure agreement (NDA). That includes the group members and SDU. SDU will sign this on behalf of the supervisor(s) and censor. You can get the ball rolling by contacting \href{mailto:contracts@sdu.dk}{contracts@sdu.dk}. But before doing so, you should read their intro\footnote{\url{https://www.sdu.dk/en/om_sdu/institutter_centre/tekinnovation/for_studerende/nda}}.

% warning
You should, however, be aware that getting an NDA in place can be a lengthy process. All parties need to agree on the legalese and that means that representatives of the legal organizations have to dead through the document and agree on the contents. SDU has a standard NDA, but the industrial partner may not be happy about it. Expect this process to be measured in months, and expect not to have access to material from the industrial collaborators before it is in place. If you are doing a 40 ECTS project that is likely to be highly inconvenient, but if you are doing a 30 ECTS project that can quickly become detrimental. The lesson learned is to start as early as possible, and aim to have that NDA in place \textsl{before} handing in the project description.

\section{Deadlines}

At SDU there are a few deadlines to be concerned with. These are:
\begin{itemize}
  \item The deadline for signing up for a 40 ECTS MSc project and is, naturally, only applicable to MSc projects. See section \ref{sec:projectsize} for details.
  \item The deadline of handing in the project description. Please note that this needs to be approved. See section \ref{sec:projectdesc} for details.
  \item Usually (but not always) there is a poster session approx 1 month before handin of the final report. It may be mandatory for you and it may be optional.
  \item The deadline of handing in the final report.
\end{itemize}

\chapter{Evaluation}

% intro:
When you have constructed your system, you have certainly achieved something. But at that point we know very little about \textsl{what} you have achieved. Does it work correctly? How well does it meet the requirements? To be able to make claims in these regards, you need an evaluation. What and how you need to evaluate depends on which kinds of claims you wish to make. At the end of the day the claims supported by your evaluation will define the success of the system. From a report perspective, that is.

% TODO: needs a rewrite:
My recommendation is for you to think the evaluation into the design so that you end up designing for evaluation. One benefit of that would be that your mental model of the evaluation process evolves along with the project. Another would be that that you end up having natural points for instrumentation in the codebase that gives you exactly the kind of access that you need for your *ideal* evaluation.

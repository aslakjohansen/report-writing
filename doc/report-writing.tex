\chapter{Introduction}
\label{chap:introintro}

% experience: same questions, poor writing quality
As a project advisor I have observed some patterns. One is that the number of groups that I supervise is growing. Another is that there are a fairly large set of questions that almost every group pose. And a third is that most groups produce report of very low (writing) quality. All of this adds to the workload of the advisor\idx{Advisor}, but they affect the \textsl{feeling} of that workload differently. This document is an attempt at reducing the daunting sides of this workload while giving students a better experience and improving their ability to communicate in writing.

% writing: significantly affects reading experience, 1 paragraph [3 good, 2 irrelevant and 1 bad sentence] example, how should it be graded
A badly written report significantly affects the reading experience. When you struggle to understand a sentence you tend to loose the context of the flow. That is a language problem. But there can also be trust\idx{Trust} problem. For instance, I often come across a paragraph with 3 good, 2 irrelevant and 1 bad sentence. By \quoted{\textsl{good}} I mean on point, and by \quoted{\textsl{bad}} I mean incorrect. This is quite a conundrum: How should this be graded? Concretely;
\begin{enumerate}
  \item How should the 3 good and the 1 bad sentence be weighed?
  \item Does the student(s) realize that they have written two irrelevant sentences? If not, then this is a problem.
\end{enumerate}

% purpose: reduce load by documenting answers to common questions and providing the tools needed for writing a good report, large document, not all chapters are relevant to all projects, understand and follow all these guidelines and you are writing at PhD level.
The original idea behind this document was to reduce my load by documenting answers to common questions and providing the tools needed for writing a good report. This has resulted in a rather large (and yet nowhere complete) document. The gaps are being filled, but it is still some way off. However, not all chapters are relevant to all projects. The moment you understand and follow all these guidelines consistently (unless you have reasons not to), you are writing at PhD level. That is not expected of MSc let alone BSc students, but this is a skill that will help you in your professional life\idx{Professional life}, independently of whether you end up going for industry or academia. When you read this guide, consider which parts you like and which you don't like. Replicate those you like, and find a different solution for those you don't.

% line coverage
\textbf{Note:} This covers the final BSc and MSc projects in what is being referred to as the \quoted{software educations} at SDU. These are software technology and software engineering, but not computer science.

\section{Reading Guide}

When to read what:
\begin{itemize}
  \item About halfway through your 8th semester, you should consider whether you want to do a 40 ECTS MSc project. Read section \ref{sec:projectsize}.
  \item Half a year before project start, read section \ref{sec:industrialcolab} for pitfalls on industrial collaboration.
  \item When you start considering how to go about deciding on a project, read chapter \ref{chap:introintro}.
  \item Skim the appendices at the when you are considering your project.
  \item Before you start writing, read chapter \ref{chap:artofwriting}.
  \item As you progress through the project, you should read chapters \ref{chap:intro}-\ref{chap:conclusion}. The substructure of these chapters is meant to cover themes rather than represent a proposition for a project report. Make sure that you have read the chapter covering step $n+1$ before you start on step $n$.
  \item After having handed in, you should read chapter \ref{chap:posthandin} on the defense.
  \item Before starting on your final project, but no later than the beginning of your MSc, you should read chapter \ref{chap:afterlife}.
\end{itemize}

\section{Computer Science}

% definition in relation to software engineering
\idx{Computer science}
Computer science (da: Datalogi) is the study of computation and information. It covers fields such as compiler theory, operating system design, networks, distributed systems, graphics, data modeling, database system design, artificial intelligence and machine learning. Notably, the \textsl{customer}\idx{Customer} is left out. In the US, computer scientists who work in the industry are called \textsl{software engineers}\idxx{Software engineer!in the US}{Software engineer}. It is important to differentiate this from what is taught at the Danish \quoted{software engineering} educations. Figure \ref{fig:se-vs-cs} attempts to highlight how the two relates to each other. In general, computer scientists produce\idxx{Technology!Producer}{Technology producer} technology (e.g., frameworks) with a broad appeal while software engineers (the Danish variant) consume\idxx{Technology!Consumer}{Technology consumer} such technology to solve a concrete problem for a specific customer.

\section{Software Engineering}

% definition: high-level (technically adept in engineering software solutions for a concrete purpose and all processes related to the entire lifecycle of everything that has to do with that software), very wide domain of expertise, limited understanding of the underlying mechanics
Software solutions\idx{Software solution} are engineered \ldots\ by software engineers\idx{Software engineer}. Software engineers are technically adept in (i) engineering software solutions for a concrete purpose and (ii) all processes related to the entire lifecycle\idx{Lifecycle} of everything that has to do with that software. This requires skills spanning a very wide domain of expertise. Accordingly, they have a limited understanding of how the underlying mechanics function.

% the good software engineer: taking into account resource needs (e.g., time, money)
This means that software engineers -- in all of their acts seek to balance the technical perfection with the resources\idx{Resources} (e.g., time and money) necessary to achieve that. Because software development is a time-intensive\idx{Time-intensive} process, most software engineering work ends up being a matter of glue-code\idx{Glue code} that can combine the functionality of existing frameworks\idx{Framework} and systems in such a way that it delivers value to the project stakeholders\idx{Stakeholder}. Large parts of this ends up being a matter of what computer scientists refer to as \textsl{configuration}\idx{Configuration}. This allows software engineers to deliver solutions to concrete problems in little time.

% the good software engineer: fallback to computer science, example (when no suitable -- ref to ALL requirements [current and future] -- framework can be found)
However, when no suitable framework can be found to fit \underline{all} of the requirements -- both current and future -- the software engineers will have to fall back on computer science\idx{Computer science}. The good software engineer will thus either be able to operate as a computer scientist (e.g., by creating the needed framework) or realize their own inability to solve the problem at hand and delegate it to someone (i.e., a computer scientist) who can.

% point
It is your job to show -- through your project -- that you can take on the role of a software engineer. This involves working on a concrete software problem while (i) taking into account external constraints like resources, and (ii) stepping into the shoes of a computer scientist if need be.

\section{Learning Objectives}

\begin{inspiration}{Yoda\idx{Yoda}\cite{empire}}
  \textbf{Context:} \textsl{Luke quietly agrees to give something a try.}
  \\
  \\
  \quoted{No! Try not. Do. Or do not. There is no try.}
\end{inspiration}

% what are learning objectives? ILO's, targets individuals, type of project maps to weights
Each course at SDU has a set of intended learning outcomes (or ILOs\idx{ILO}). These are listed in the course descriptions under the term \textsl{learning objectives}\idx{Learning objectives}. This is essentially a listing of what you are supposed to demonstrate proficiency of, and what you will eventually be graded on. They apply to all students in a group individually. As each project is different the weighing of the objectives depends on the type of project. However, that does not mean that an objective can go away completely.

% grading
How you project is graded\idx{Grading} depends on the severity and number of weaknesses in demonstrating this proficiency. Due to the construction of the scale, the way to get a high grade is to raise the lower end of your objective spectrum. That is, first to make sure that you don't have any major issues, and then to incrementally progress towards not having any minor issues.

% what to do with these?
Before your project your should definitely read the relevant learning objectives, and come up with a plan\idxx{Learning objectives!Plan for achieving}{Achieving} for how you will fulfill each of them. Maybe add each of them to the relevant sections, as precisely as possible, as comments. This way you will know that you have to focus on showing that you have fulfilled these.

% disclaimer
Be aware that the set of learning objectives change over time, and that -- even though effort has been made to make these as objective as possible -- they are subject to individual interpretation. What matters is that your advisor(s)\idx{Advisor} feels like they can argue to the censor that the objectives have been fulfilled.

\subsection{Role}

% intro
An advisor is just that; someone why advises. While the advisor may have ideas for projects in various states of development, at the end of the day, it is always the students project\idxx{Student!Role}{Role of student}. They are the ones who do the work. They are the ones who get to own the resulting code\footnote{That is, unless external restrictions apply. These could be that the project is centered around extending some open source code (then the resulting code should be freely available), or that you have an agreement with an external partner (in which case that may include restrictions).}. They are the ones who will be evaluated. It is their project, and they have to own it. It is the role of the advisor\idxx{Advisor!Role}{Role of advisor} to help the students navigate all aspects of the project, but they are the ones who make the decisions. Even if the project idea initially came from the advisor.

% inclusion [report structure (when presented with text of reasonable quality)], exclusion [basic grammar, spelling]
With regards to the report, the advisor can give input on the structure when presented with text of reasonable quality. This will always be a best-effort after having skimmed the text. You should not expect feedback on basic grammar and spelling.

\subsection{Interaction}

\idxx{Advisor!Interaction}{Interacting with advisor} The perfect interaction model for supervision depends on the specific project. However, as a starting point I like to have a weekly recurring status meeting of 30 minutes that goes into the calendar. That way there is time allocated. If I don't receive an agenda over Discord 24 hours before the meeting I consider it canceled and may reallocate the time. In some weeks there won't be anything to cover in this status meeting, and in other weeks there may be a need for an extra meeting.

When it comes to the day-to-day supervision (aka the small questions and messages) I find that a per-project Discord\idx{Discord} channels works best. That setup also integrates well with online meetings and screensharing.

\subsection{Choice}

% intro: partnership
\idxx{Advisor!Choice}{Choosing advisor} The relationship between the students of a group, their advisor(s) is a partnership. Ideally, all partners should get something out of it. From the advisors side that will usually be a domain or field of interest, and the project could be rooted in a research project.

% if it doesnt work out
If you have a negative previous experience with a potential advisor (e.g., from a bachelor project), then you should obviously look elsewhere. Do note that this is does not have to indicate more that incompatibilities of personality types.

% reasons
Good reasons to choose a advisor may include:
\begin{itemize}
  \item You like the advisor on a personal level. Do note that supervision is not a personal relationship.
  \item You have enjoyed classes taught by the advisor. Do note that supervision style may differ from teaching style.
  \item Overlap in technological interests.
  \item Overlap in domain interests.
\end{itemize}

\section{Project Size}
\label{sec:projectsize}

% project length
\idx{Project size} Currently, at SDU, a BSc project is 15 ECTS points across the spring semester, and a MSc project is either 30 ECTS points across the spring semester or 40 ECTS points across two semesters starting in the fall. The workload of the 40 ECTS variant is distributed so that 10 ECTS points are placed in the fall semester and the remaining 30 ECTS points fill up the entire spring semester. When that model is followed, the fall semester is typically spent interviewing stakeholders, doing the literature review and generally laying things out so that everything is ready for a focused spring semester.

If you have found a project that gets you excited, and you should, then I really recommend that you choose a 40 ECTS point MSc. The 30 ECTS points variant has a tendency to get crammed. Another way of looking at this is that a 30 ECTS MSc is spread across 4 months, and a 40 ECTS MSc is spread across 9 months. Some problems require time (in the back of your heads), and then those extra 5 months come in handy. Anything that goes wrong (e.g., illness, or stakeholder unavailability) will end up taking up a significantly smaller fraction of your time.

\textbf{Note:} Be aware that there is a deadline for applying for a 40 ECTS project.

\section{Group Composition}

% don't do it alone
\idx{Group composition} Groups of one can work, but they rarely do. What usually happens is that -- lacking experience with a project of this size -- the student starts postponing tasks (e.g., due to waning motivation). Groups of two are much more robust in that sense, likely due to a combination of a feeling of responsibility towards the other group member and the shared support structure. Groups of three can also work, but here the trick becomes (i) to size to project workload, and (ii) to make it clear that all have done their fair share of the project.

% friends but not too good friends
It is important for group members to be on good terms. Positive experience from previous groupwork is a plus. However, groups consisting of too \textsl{good} friends have a tendency to find topics irrelevant to the project to spend their time on. While that is a healthy thing it is not conductive in terms of progressing the project.

\section{Project Choice}

\begin{inspiration}{Jane Goodall\idxx{Goodall, Jane}{Jane Goodall}\cite{goodall1974}}
  \quoted{You cannot get through a single day without having an impact on the world around you. What you do makes a difference, and \textbf{you have to decide what kind of difference you want to make}.}
\end{inspiration}

% se bsc:
The software engineering BSc project is 50\% larger than any project you have done so far, and you have fewer hands to lift it. That is not a big difference from the semester\idx{Semester project} projects that you are used to. The big difference is that \textsl{you} have to do your due diligence. You probably don't realize how much effort was put into the semester projects: Coming up with a (hopefully) interesting case, making sure that you will encounter class-relevant obstacles, making sure that you have the tools to overcome those obstacles, and making sure that you won't encounter any other obstacles. Basically, somebody else made sure that you would get through. In this project, you have no such person. Luckily, you are not expected to end world hunger. You are just expected to show that you can use the tools you were given throughout your education.

% st bsc and msc:
The software technology BSc and (especially) software engineering MSc, are different beasts. The workload is significantly higher, and -- in the case of a 40 ECTS MSc -- also spans significantly longer. This is time, and work, that you commit to a single project. So it better be worth it! Especially after 3 months of working on it full-time. Motivation i key here. How do you keep it up?

% overall: find a project that speaks to you
So, find a project that speaks to you, and consider:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Which domains do you find interesting?
  \item You should make sure that part of your project relies on technology that you are confident in. This could be programming language or DBMS\idx{DBMS}.
  \item For software technology BSc and software engineering MSc:
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Which types of problems do you find interesting?
      \item The title is going to be visible to future employers. What do you want them to see?
      \item You will need to learn some new technologies. Pick areas that you find interesting. You won't know for sure which specific technologies you are going to work with before you have started the project\footnote{That choice has to be informed after an analysis of the problem space and the solution space}, but you will know the areas.
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\section{Industrial Collaboration}
\label{sec:industrialcolab}

% positive
\idx{Industrial collaboration}Having an industrial partner is a project is usually one of the great motivators. It feels like an immediate rubber stamping of the applicability of the project, and that will often result in a higher degree of clarity regarding the project goals. That, in turn, makes it easier to reason about decisions throughout the project.

% seen through the eyes of the company
Companies may have several reasons for participating in a BSc/MSc project:
\begin{itemize}
  \item They can use the extra hands. This primarily applies to small companies.
  \item They want a space explored\idx{Explorative project}, and having somebody else do the heavy lifting is good business.
  \item They get to interact with a potential future employee (who appears to have shared interests). At a time where there is a shortage of software developers, this is often a \textsl{really} good deal for them. It won't cost them much.
\end{itemize}

% negative
There are, however, also a number of (potential) negative implications:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Industrial partners often have busy schedules. Sometimes it takes weeks to get a meeting.
  \item Some industrial partners will try to control the flow of information to \quoted{make sure you only get the information they think you need at this point in time}. This is them trying to do you a favor by \textsl{not} throwing all the complexity at you. But in reality, this filtering of information robs you of the ability to get an overview of the problem space.
  \item An industrial collaborator may want an NDA\index{NDA}, and that process can be slow. See section \ref{nda}.
  \item It does happen (rarely though) that the company looses interest in the project (e.g., after an acquisition or other strategic adjustment). Notify your advisor if this happens.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Non-Disclosure Agreement}
\label{nda}

% purpose and involvement
\idxx{NDA}{NDA} Often, an industrial collaborator will insist on the anyone coming into contact with what they consider company secrets to sign a nondisclosure agreement (NDA). That includes the group members and SDU. SDU will sign this on behalf of the advisor(s) and censor. You can get the ball rolling by contacting \href{mailto:contracts@sdu.dk}{contracts@sdu.dk}. But before doing so, you should read their intro\footnote{\url{https://www.sdu.dk/en/om_sdu/institutter_centre/tekinnovation/for_studerende/nda}}.

% warning
You should, however, be aware that getting an NDA in place can be a lengthy process. All parties need to agree on the legalese and that means that representatives of the legal organizations have to dead through the document and agree on the contents. SDU has a standard NDA, but the industrial partner may not be happy about it. Expect this process to be measured in months, and expect not to have access to material from the industrial collaborators before it is in place. If you are doing a 40 ECTS project that is likely to be highly inconvenient, but if you are doing a 30 ECTS project that can quickly become detrimental. The lesson learned is to start as early as possible, and aim to have that NDA in place \textsl{before} handing in the project description.

\section{Product}

% main product of a project is the report, difference in level of importance, report should be the driver not the afterthought, code inclusion as an example
In a project like these (BSc/MSc, that is), the main product\idxx{Product!of project}{Product} of the project is the report. The code is significantly less important. In fact, its primary purpose is to allow you to write the report. The report should be considered the project driver instead of an afterthought. While code naturally has to be developed outside of the report, when including snippets\idx{Code inclusion} of it, it should be done on the premises of the report; not as a screenshot.

\section{Deadlines}

\idx{Deadlines} At SDU there are a few deadlines to be concerned with. These are:
\begin{itemize}
  \item The deadline for signing up for a 40 ECTS MSc project and is, naturally, only applicable to MSc projects. See section \ref{sec:projectsize} for details.
  \item The deadline of handing in the project description. Please note that this needs to be approved. See section \ref{sec:projectdesc} for details.
  \item Usually (but not always) there is a poster session approx 1 month before handin of the final report. It may be mandatory for you and it may be optional.
  \item The deadline of handing in the final report.
\end{itemize}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% Project Description
\chapter{Project Description}
\label{sec:projectdesc}

\idx{Project description} The project description is a document you hand in via \url{spoc.sdu.dk}. This document frames your project by describing which problem you will be addressing and how you plan on doing so. When writing this, it is important to keep your learning objectives in mind. Through the report you end up writing for this project, it should be clear to censor that you have reached all of your learning objectives.

But lets imagine that you end up with a project description that makes it is impossible for you to do any work that relates to one of the learning objectives. Accordingly, it will be impossible for you to not a have at least one major weakness, and thus you cannot possibly get a higher grade than 7.

The strategy for getting the best possible grade\idx{Grade} (on the Danish 7-point grading scale) is to focus on doing best in the worst of the learning objectives. This is a direct consequence of the focus on weaknesses. However, all projects are different and not all learning objectives are equally important for all projects. At the end of the day, all learning objectives are in effect, only with weights depending on the concrete project.

\section{Structure}

The structure of the project description is not set in stone. I usually recommend following the following template:

\begin{enumerate}
  \descitem{Context} \idx{Context} This section covers all background information necessary for understanding the \say{Problem} and \say{Approach} sections. If the project is grounded by an industrial partner, then this partner should be introduced using one paragraph. This section is typically less than one page, and can be as short as one paragraph.
  \descitem{Problem} \idx{Problem} This section contains the problem statement, and absolutely nothing besides the problem statement. A problem statement can take many forms. Often, it is a (research) question that you seek to answer, and that is typically decomposed into a (small) number of subquestions. This section usually takes up less than half a page.
  \descitem{Approach} \idx{Approach} This section briefly details \textsl{how} you plan to answer this question. This does not relate to the process, but the overall technological choices. Note that you are allowed to make changes to this once you progress through the project itself. This section usually takes up less than half a page.
  \descitem{Timeline} \idx{Timeline} Describe how you plan to organize your project period time. Usually, this includes a Gantt diagram covering the basics: Problem elaboration, related work, analysis, design, implementation, and evaluation\footnote{Experimental evaluation takes significantly longer than you would expect. Multiplying the time you expect by four is likely a good call.}. You should also cover to which degree you want to work iteratively, and how you plan on interacting with your advisor(s)\footnote{My suggestion is to have short weekly meetings with your advisor(s). No later that 24h before the meeting you send an agenda. If you fail to do so the advisor(s) are allowed to reschedule that timeslot.}.
  \descitem{Preliminaries/Feasibility} \idxx{Feasibility}{Preliminaries Feasibility}\index{Preliminaries} With the project description you should present your preliminaries; that is the work you have done in order to conclude that the proposed project has a high likelihood of success. Examples of components this can have include (but is not limited to) a preliminary literature review, a survey, a mockup and a risk analysis. The purpose is to convince the three people approving the project description that the project is feasible. This section is usually less than a page, but can take up a few if deemed necessary.
\end{enumerate}

Note that the problem and approach sections can be reused in the final project report.

\section{Process}

The project description is handed in as a PDF file by exactly one of the group members. That group member fills out fields for the remaining group members, advisor(s) and -- if relevant -- contact person of industrial collaborator. This upload will trigger the following process:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item Each remaining group member will receive an email asking them to confirm their participation in the project.
  \item The advisor(s) then gets an email asking them to approve the project description.
  \item The head of the education then gets an email asking them to approve the project description.
  \item The head of faculty (or someone close) then gets an email asking them to approve the project description.
\end{enumerate}

A rejection in any of these steps means that you will have to reupload.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% Project Management
\chapter{Project Management}

% need
Few students have experience participating in projects the size of their BSc/MSc. Fewer yet managing such projects. Your semester\idx{Semester project} projects have been neatly laid out in such a way that project problems happen to coincide with solutions presented in semester courses. You have had deadlines and your project advisors\idx{Advisor} have made sure that the work needed for these deadlines is doable within the time given. These projects have been managed for you.

% your role
Now, it is time for you to take over this role; the role of project\idx{Project Manager} manager. That is, to plan\idx{Plan} (or structure) the work needed in such a way that you end up with a product (code and report, that is) that you are happy about within the allotted time. This touches on numerous different aspects, including:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Time management
  \item Resource management
  \item Work disaggregation
  \item Risk management
\end{itemize}

% model of plan
Briefly speaking, you need to come up with a plan for how you disaggregate the full project into small tangible work\idx{Work package} packages that are placed on a timeline. That includes a start time and a duration. Each such work packages require some set of resources, and depends on the completion of a (potentially empty) set of other work packages.

% risks
This, obviously, wont happen to perfection. To manage the risks\idx{Risk} associated with potential imperfections, we analyze each work package for risks. When appropriate (and possible) we plan for risk mitigation. This will often take the form of an alternative subgraph in the work package dependency graph that can be activated under certain conditions.

Work packages are defined by subsequently splitting (aka detailing) existing packages, starting with the whole project. Figure \ref{fig:pm:wp:disagg} attempts to illustrate this process. First, we start with the project in its entirety. We need to somehow split it into smaller pieces. How to do this will likely depend on the project type, as well as the chosen research methodology. You often see the first split based on phases; usually something like introduction, related work, analysis, design, implementation, evaluation and then some outro.

The next step is to iteratively break down these work packages into smaller pieces while keeping tract of their dependencies. You stop once each resulting work package is tangible enough for you to assign it a duration, or when it becomes too nebulous to make sense. In the latter case, you should ask yourself whether you are well enough informed at this point? If not, is it reasonable to think that you will become it, or is your project\idxx{Project!explorative}{Explorative project} of an explorative nature? Projects of an explorative nature will often have clear and tangible work packages in the near future, and have progressively more uncertainty associated with them as we look further into the future.

Ideally, we stop the process once every work package has been assigned a duration. A final sanity check reveals whether this is doable within the project period (and not too much shorter time). If that is not the case, then you should revisit one of the previous stages.

Another approach would be to assign time to each work package before you subdivide them. Then, to be on the safe side, the longest dependency path within the new set of work packages should -- assuming that you have enough group members to do the concurrent work packages -- have the same duration as the original work package.

\section{Work Management}

% mostly to match the timeline: about making sure that all human resources will always be utilized
Work management is about keeping the dependency graph of tasks mapped to one timeline per group member. Some tasks will map to individual group members and some will map to multiple. As these tasks gets worked on you start to realize that some go by faster than expected and others take longer. This may trigger a need for adjustments in the mapping in order to keep all group members utilized\idx{Utilization}.

% no need to materialize the timeline mappings
% matching fields of interests
It should be noted that these timeline mappings don't need to be fully materialized until the end of the project. In fact, doing so would add rigidity to the process of adjusting to the changing conditions. One could envision a system where this was done automatically, and tasks to dynamically shifted around to group members with the right set of qualifications. That would likely be detrimental to morale\idx{Morale} and efficiency though. Instead, try to map tasks to the interests of individual group members some time in advance. That way, you can work on one thing while considering how a future task should be addressed.

\subsection{Critical Path}

People often talk about a critical\idx{Critical path} path. It is the shortest path through the dependency graph. Intuitively, that defines the shortest possible amount of time needed to complete the project. This works out fairly well for projects of a single person. Most groups consists for multiple group members though, and this complicates things. One the one hand you have twice the number of man-hours, but on the other hand you can -- in principle -- work on two concurrent tasks at the same time. And thus, the single path model no longer applies. You might get something useful out of reasoning about the longest of the two shortest non-overlapping paths. But that model becomes less useful.

\subsection{Delays}

% delays can happen: reasons (including illness, task turns out to be harder than anticipated)
The sad reality is that sometimes people get\idx{Illness} ill, and when they get really ill they (or those around them) cannot participate in a project like this. Such illness will result in a delay that needs to be addressed. At other times, a task turns out to be harder than anticipated. That causes it to take longer and this makes the whole plan shift. If the effects of the disruption are great enough, you will have to revisit the plan in order to (i) get a feel of the implications, and (ii) come up with a revised plan.

\section{Time Management}

Each work package is associated with at least an expected duration (which could be a range), a set of resources, and a set of work package dependencies. This will allow you to reason about
\begin{itemize}
  \item Which work packages cannot be worked on in parallel.
  \item When work on a certain task can begin at the earliest.
  \item The feasibility of a plan (task $\mapsto$ time range mapping).
\end{itemize}

Sometimes you may be ahead of your plan. Do you then give yourself a bonus break, or do you carry on knowing that you will be under less pressure moving on? At other times, you may be behind schedule. This is a much more likely situation. You should always have a bit of slack\idx{Slack}, but only a bit.

% decisions: work longer to catch up, or skip task, dependency graphs can help one reason about consequences
Once that slack has been consumed, you will have to wake up and face reality: Either you go all in (e.g., pull an all-nighter\idx{All-nighter}) or you will be forced to reduce or cut a work package in order to meet the deadline. At times, no amount of work towards the former will fix the situation, and the situation will eventually have to be resolved through the latter mechanism. It can be important (and very hard) to recognize such situations and cut ones losses.

\subsection{Urgency}

% situation
Some projects suffer serious delays. It could be that the project started late, or that access to an external resource came very late. As a advisor, I have seen both, and the implications were counted in months.

% natural reaction
In such situations, any plan that may exist can no longer stand up against the reality of the situation. For it to become useful, significant work has to be directed at it. That, however, will take time away from progressing the project and that time is now at a premium. Most students will push the plan aside -- along with most of what they have learned about good project work -- and start coding towards the end goal. Why not start with the analysis or the design? Because the implementation is what delivers the product. Except that it is not! The primary product is the report. What went wrong was that the stress of the feeling of urgency caused bad decisions to be made. This is one of the mechanism that scammers\idx{Scammer} seek to exploit.

% alternative reaction
It you have very little time left, then the right decision is to go for it. But otherwise, coming up with a revised\idxx{Plan!Revising}{Revised plan} plan (at any granularity) will (i) calm you down enough to now have an unpleasant time during the remaining part of the project, and (ii) allow you to focus on what matters through informed decisions.

\section{Resource Management}

% what: scarce resources, related to time management

Resources can have a number of different properties. Lets try to give examples of resources through some of their key properties:
\begin{itemize}
  \descitem{External vs Internal} Some resources are our of your control; you have to ask for access. Those are external resources\idxx{Resource!external}{External resource}. Lets say that you are doing a project with a company, and you need an interview with a stakeholder from that company. That stakeholder is likely to take a few days replying and agree to a date a week or two later. That is an external resource. You have to plan around them and make sure that you will have reasonable things to do while waiting for them. Internal\idxx{Resource!internal}{Internal resource} resources are easier though. They are under your control. Examples include group members and computers owned by group members.
  \descitem{Budgets} Ideally, all resources should always be available to you, but in reality some come with budgets. Examples include:
    \begin{itemize}
      \item A representative for a company you are collaborating with may have agreed to give you 6 hours of their time.
      \item A free cloud account (such as those given to students) work on a credit system, and at the end of the day, only that many credits are free. If you break that budget you may have to put in your own money. This is a \textsl{soft}\idxx{Budget!soft}{Soft budget} budget.
      \item If you are doing time-critical work, like performance evaluation, then all participating components must be dedicated to this job. So, if you are benchmarking some code on a laptop, then it cannot be used to look stuff up on the internet or write report. For this work package the laptop is a fully consumed\idxx{Resource!consumed}{Consumed resource} resource.
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

It is your job to lay out work packages in such a way that all resource constraints are satisfied and that the utilization of scarce resources is optimized. For instance, all project members should always have something to do.

\section{Risk Management}

\begin{inspiration}{Nick Fury\idxx{Fury, Nick}{Nick Fury}\cite{avengers}}
  \quoted{Until such time as the world ends, we will act as though it intends to spin on.}
\end{inspiration}

% things go wrong
With a project this size, chances are that things will go wrong; assumptions will turn out not to hold and (parts of) your plan will go out the window. How bad this is depends on (i) experience, (ii) how much work went into constructing a realistic plan, and (iii) the contingencies you have in place.

% the balance of risk management
Risk management involves a number of exercises in managing risk. They all involve a tradeoff\idx{Tradeoff} between the inefficiency of constructing the perfect plan (which ideally involves you completing the project) and the penalty of not having done the work when shit hits the fan. As always in tradeoffs, a balance is needed.

% starting point
A good starting point is to make a list of things that can go wrong; uncertainties, assumptions, dependencies on external factors and similar things that could turn out against your favor. For each item you list how likely it is to turn problematic and how bad such an event would be. This combination of risk and severity informs how important it is to have a contingency, and thus how much effort you should throw at coming up with such.

\section{Tools}

% google docs
Many people like to work in Google Docs\idx{Google Docs}, and it truly is convenient for many things. However, the typographical qualities of the resulting PDF are awful. After having seen a a great many reports written in Google Docs, I have reached the conclusion that it is likely impossible to create a remotely professional looking report in Google Docs.

% microsoft word
Microsoft Word\idxx{Microsoft!Word}{Microsoft Word} is an alternative. I have heard many students say that it is possible to create a professionally looking report in Microsoft Word, and they have all failed to do so. I am starting to think that it is possible to get quite close, but that the effort required is ridiculously high. The same goes for Libre/Open Office.

% latex
\LaTeX\ \idxx{LaTeX@\LaTeX}{\LaTeX} has all the right typographical rules needed, and it will allow you to tweak everything to your hearts desire. But, crucially, you don't have to. If you don't want to know about these things, then just use the (generally) sensible defaults, and you are already ahead.

% working with latex
\LaTeX\ is written as code in plain text files, and can therefore easily live in a git repository. It is a good practice to have a single sentence per line. It is worth the effort when the merge conflicts hits you. There are online \LaTeX\ editors (e.g., Overleaf) that can be linked to such a git repository. But do \underline{not} rely on them. Their uptime is not impressive.

% linking to code
Finally, there are benefits to having the report code\idx{Code inclusion} either in the same repository as the project code, or in one that is checked out at a well defined path relative to the code repository. This allows for inclusions and automatic building of the report (e.g., to include results of tests or code snippets).

% required features
Generally speaking I would expect support for the following in an even remotely modern system for writing IT related reports:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Inclusion of external standardized vector graphics formats\footnote{Note that many vector graphics formats support the inclusion of bitmapped graphics. Doing so to a screenshot does not make the result vector graphics.} (e.g., PDF and SVG) without going through rasterization.
  \item Support for ligatures.
  \item Proper support for kerning.
  \item Automatic inclusion and highlight of code.
  \item Floats.
  \item References that \say{just work}.
  \item Citation system.
  \item Automatic table of contents.
\end{itemize}

% why the focus
Why does it matter? First of all, it shows that you care. If you did not care very much about this report, why should the reader? Secondly, it is obvious whether or not you used the right tools. If you don't command the right tools as an engineer, that's a problem right there!

\section{Process}

\idx{Writing process} A report is a structured text that is made up of chapters. Each chapter is in turn made up of sections, each section of subsections, each subsection of paragraphs, and each paragraph of sentences. You may forego the chapter level, and add further subsections if that happens to be a better fit. Paragraphs can be placed at any level of sections. Also, each section may have an introductory paragraph. Figure \ref{fig:firststeps:process:bnf} illustrates this in BNF, and it should be clear to you that this is an example of a tree structure.

% differences in opinion
But how do you come up with that tree structure; the \textsl{right} tree structure? People tend to prefer one of two strategies, and despise the other. I have seen both work for people who chose it of their own free will.

% first strat
The first strategy is to first get something (anything, really) down \say{on paper}, and then iterate and keep on iterating until the end result is good. I am not a fan of this approach. Generally, it requires a lot of writing experience to succeed, the overhead of repeated iterations is high, and the iterations usually end up being cut short before a good result has been reached.

% second strat
The second strategy is to go top-down by growing the tree from the root. Only after understanding the final structure of a node (at a single level of depth) are you allowed to dig into a child node. Note that this allows you to go deep in some parts of the report while having little understanding of others.

% second strat: mindset
That implies a process of considering the topic of the node and all that came before it, and deciding:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Which key points have to be covered?
  \item Which pseudo points are needed to support these?
  \item What is the best way of serializing the coverage of all of these points?
  \item How can that sequence be broken down into themes?
\end{enumerate}
These themes are your subsections. Often it makes sense to consider naming conventions that transcends a single subtree to bring some consistency to the report.

% second strat: tool
Large reports can become hard to navigate and conclusions on the exact contents of som subsection may escape memory. One way of dealing with this is to write down pre and post conditions for individual (sub*)sections. This works particularly well in \LaTeX\ where you have comments:

\begin{minted}[breaklines]{latex}
\subsection{Publish Subscribe Substrates}
\label{sec:analysis:transport:pubsub}
% pre: It has been established that a transport is needed for moving streaming data from backend to front-end at a rate of 10-20Hz. Parameters for evaluation: [latency, throughput, robustness, inspection].
% post: A clear definition of the pros and cons of using pubsub for this purpose.
\end{minted}

\section{Working Document}

% early first document
It is a good practice in a project to quickly establish a working report document. That gives you a natural area to drop notes about your design choices (so that you can later remember why you did things the way you ended up doing them) and have a low bar for writing on your report should you suddenly feel inspired. You can organically structure the report as your perception of its shape matures, and -- if frequently visited -- it will keep your mind fixed on which details matter for the end-goal of producing the report handin.

% fill out as you go along
This document represents a dissertation. In the beginning of it you are likely to have a central thesis, or maybe a number of theses that you wish to explore. The starting point is what you came up with in your project description (see section \ref{sec:projectdesc}). I recommend filling out the contents of each section as you go through the corresponding phases of the project. That way the details are still sharp in your mind, it is easy to make sure that you don't miss anything, and you don't end up with a whole lot of report work at the end.

% glossary
As you, throughout the project, encounter domain specific abbreviations, make sure to add them to a glossary\idx{Glossary}. That way, you yourselves can rely on it throughout the remainder of the project, and you won't have to consider whether to do it poorly at the end. You can always choose to comment it out at a later point.

\section{Report Structure}

Throughout the project you will have a workflow\idx{Workflow}, that typically consists of a series of processes each resulting in a work product. A typical workflow is illustrated in figure \ref{fig:first:overview} along with an illustration of how each part of this flow is normally mapped to a section. Do note that the \textsl{right} workflow (and structure) depends on the nature of the project. In particular, a project that is \textsl{explorative}\idx{Explorative project} in nature will likely look significantly different. Also note that the chain illustrated in this figure represents a \textsl{proof} that the conclusion fits the discovered problem. If the chain is broken, that conclusion ceases to be valid for the problem and that results in what -- in grading terminology -- is called a major weakness\idxx{Weakness!Major}{Major weakness}.

The following is a good starting point for the structure\idx{Report structure} of most reports. If you end up with \textsl{interesting} parts of your implementation then you can add an \textdesc{Implementation} section. However, we do -- especially at the MSc level -- expect you to be able to write code, and we generally don't care about you choosing a \keywordname{for} loop over a \keywordname{while} loop.

\end{inspiration}

% writing is a directed effort
Writing requires directed effort that considers what comes later in addition to what came before. Very few people can produce good text without laying a plan. The rest of us will have spend -- seemingly unproductive -- time considering what exactly it is we want to convey, how that fits into a narrative and which words to use in order to best express that narrative.

\section{Quality}
\idx{Quality}

% NOTE: This quote appears in the movie, not in the book
\begin{inspiration}{Albus Dumbledore\idxx{Dumbledore!Albus}{Albus Dumbledore}\cite{gobletmovie}}
  \quoted{Dark and difficult times lie ahead. Soon we must all face the choice between what is right and what is easy.}
\end{inspiration}

% product vs report
In reference, I often hear students differentiate between the product\idx{Product} and the report. Here, the product refers to \textsl{the code}; typically a single piece of software solving a single problem. In reality, there will often be variations of the code, and perhaps even multiple pieces of code. More relevantly, this wrongly puts the onus on the code. The code is the subject of your project, but it is not what you are evaluated on. For the purpose of the evaluation (of you; the student), the product is the report.

% keeping the level high
It is crucial to see the report as the main product of the project. Like a good software developer will make sure to care about coding conventions and code quality, a good writer will care about punctuation, readability, structure, and each of the individual parts of the message that the report resents. You need to be the best writer that you can be, and keep the quality high.

% resources
The is a myriad of intricacies in a project. Which ones do you report on, how do you do so, and in which order? This requires effort, and that this effort is highly conductive to the project as a whole.
It also takes time, and more so if you are not accustomed to it. The complexity of this job deserves respect, and with it your time. That effort will extend to the reader of the final report. This takes away from your coding time, but that is of less importance anyways.

\section{Storytelling}
\idx{Storytelling}

\begin{inspiration}{The Eleventh Doctor\idxx{Doctor!The eleventh}{The eleventh doctor}\cite{drwho_s5e13}}
  \quoted{We're all stories, in the end. Just make it a good one, eh?}
\end{inspiration}

% having a goal, project: directing work towards this goal, at the end material (experiences) have been produced
The project starts out with a well-defined goal\idx{Goal}. Throughout the project, work is directed towards this goal, and on the way material and experiences are produced.

% the goal in the report is to capture a subset of these experiences that represent one -- or more -- units of knowledge that can be represented in an easily accessible way, the report tells the story behind these units of knowledge
Even when the work behind this has been well directed, some will end up as dead\idx{Dead end} ends. You may also realize that the original problem is more complex than first anticipated and that not all the outcomes fit into a consistent whole. The purpose of the report is to capture a subset of these experiences that represent one -- or more -- units\idxx{Knowledge!Unit of}{Unit of knowledge} of knowledge that can be represented in an easily accessible way. The report tells the story of these units of knowledge.

% the story may not become clear before the end, may have to skip part of the experiences or effort, especially if effort is not directed, should try to find a way of including it
The story may not become clear before the very end of the project. In order to make it a consistent whole, you may have to skip part of the experiences or efforts you have put into the project. This is especially the case if your effort have not been properly directed. You should try to find a way of including everything as you would otherwise not get any \say{points} for that effort. But don't force it.

% conclusion
That story starts out by posing a relevant question, and by working on that question -- through different phases -- takes a step towards a solution. It is rare that a perfect solution\idxx{Solution!Perfect}{Perfect solution} is achieved, but the reporting of the experiences throughout these phases at the very least should contribute to the body of experiences relating to this problem. Likely, you will make more tangible contributions.

\section{Commandments}

\idx{Commandments}
\begin{enumerate}
  \descitem{Make the Effort} \idx{Effort}
    As with pretty much else in life, if you want to excel at writing you need to put in significant amounts of focused work and active considerations about the nature of what makes a text good. Take pride in your work.
  \descitem{It Has to Make Sense}
    Above all else, what you do (and write) has to make sense. This should be your guiding light throughout the entire project. Much can be excused as long as the it is done for the right reasons. While this is used to balance learning objectives according to the individual project, in cannot completely remove a learning objective.
  \descitem{Give and Take Credit} \idx{Credit}
    In order to evaluate the contribution of a text it is necessary to know which parts the author has been responsible for contributing. If some insight, term or similar is original, then credit should be given to the author. If not, then credit should be given to the original authors (e.g., through a citation) and credit should be given to the author for citing them. It is bad practice to leave credit unclear, and it erodes overall confidence in the text itself. Therefore, always make sure that you give credit where it is needed, and take credit where you can.
  \descitem{Best Practices are Fallacies} \idx{Best practices}
    While it is a good practice to explore best practices, real projects never seem to be quite that simple. Best practices are based on typical situations, and it is thus a good practice to be critical towards them. You will likely have to violate\idx{Fallacy} one or two of them.
  \descitem{Do not Underestimate Experimental Evaluation} \idxx{Evaluation!Experimental}{Experimental evaluation}
    When working on something of experimental nature it is hard to assess the time to completion. Before beginning the work it is harder. Does all the needed experimental tooling already exists, or do you need to construct parts of it yourself? How many repetitions are necessary to get trustworthy results? How much time is needed to conduct the experiments? Which kinds of post processing of results are needed to reach the relevant insights?
    However long you think it is going to take, it is going to take longer. In part because things are going to go wrong, and you might realize that your design needs to change. For that to even be a possibility, you need to start experimental work early. A good rule of thumb is to take the time you expect it to take, and multiply it by $\pi$.
  \descitem{Respect your Audience} \idx{Audience}
    You are writing a report because you expect someone to read it. Knowing who that someone is is key to understanding what is necessary in order to convey your subject. You can expect your reader to have an IT-related background and at least an MSc. Also, you should expect the reader to print your report on A4 paper. A consequence of this is that you cannot rely on the reader zooming in to read certain parts of a figure.
    \begin{inspiration}[0.82]{Rupert Giles\idxx{Giles, Rupert}{Rupert Giles}\cite{buffy_s1e8}}
      \quoted{Smell is the most powerful trigger to the memory there is. A certain flower or a whiff of smoke can bring up experiences long forgotten. Books smell musty and rich. The knowledge gained from a computer is \ldots\ it has no texture, no context. It's there and then it's gone. If it's to last, then the getting of knowledge should be tangible. It should be, um, smelly.}
    \end{inspiration}
  \descitem{One sentence One message}
    Rarely is anything achieved by having a single sentence deliver more than a single message. Often, readability is affected negatively. A sequence of short messages, each progressing the narrative towards a point is a simple way of ensuring a concise and readable language. It takes considerable effort to shoehorn multiple messages into a single sentence without negatively affecting readability.
  \descitem{A Text Should Be Self-Contained}
    A text (e.g., a paragraph) may refer to other resources like sections, citations, appendices or floats (figures and tables), but the reader should not need to follow any of these to read the text. So, when referring to a figure\idx{Figure} make sure to highlight what you would get out of looking at it. The reader then has a \textsl{choice} of looking at the figure. In much the same way, when looking at the figure the reader should not have to look for a reference in the text for that figure in order to understand how to read it. Instead these details should be covered by a legend or the figures label.
  \descitem{The Specific-Generic Spectrum} \idx{Specific-generic spectrum}% Can we make this statement more specific to a degree where it is as wide as possible without becoming untrue for some cases?
    Most statements has (at least one) inherent specificity. That is, what it expresses fits on a scale from specific to generic. If a statement is too generic then part of it is untrue. That is obviously problematic. If a statement is too specific then it doesn't express the full gamut of the underlying mechanics. That is less-obviously problematic. Perhaps it doesn't need to be covered to make your point, but it is makes it unclear whether you actually understand those implications. So, make every statement specific to a degree where it is as wide as possible without becoming untrue for any case.
  \descitem{Make the Argument Explicit} \idx{Argument}
    When providing an argument, do not rely on the reader to fold out steps that you consider implicit. The reader may have other standards for what is implicit, or have a different cultural background where those steps are not obvious. Also, this is an opportunity to show that you can construct a line of reasoning, and that opportunity should be grabbed.
  \descitem{Remember the Context} \idx{Context}
    Everything communicated is expressed in some context. Key aspects of this context are necessary to correctly decipher the communication. Be aware of these aspects and make sure that they are shared with the reader. For instance, the word \quoted{technical} can be rooted in software, but could also be legal or mechanical. I assume that people from legal also refer to the technical aspects, but have a fairly different interpretation of what that means.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Coverage}

\begin{inspiration}{David McCullough\idxx{McCullough, David}{David McCullough}\cite{McCullough2002}}
  \quoted{Writing is thinking. To write well is to think clearly. That's why it's so hard.}
\end{inspiration}

% intro: when does this apply?
When we have several -- potentially interdependent -- decisions to make we say that there is a \textsl{decision space}\idx{Decision space} to cover. It is critical that it is obvious to the reader that the entire decision space is being covered. We say that we are \textsl{going for coverage}\idx{Coverage}. To do that, whenever we are faced with a choice, we need to consider all the options, and dive into those that cannot be ruled out. This way we prune\idxx{Search tree!Pruning}{Pruning} the search tree\idx{Search tree}. If two parts (e.g., aspects) of the decision space interact, then we need to treat them as equals and consider their interactions.

% approach: go through figure (aspect 1, 1/4 viable options, 2/4 viable options, aspect 2, 1/3 viable options, 2/2 viable options, 3/4 combinations viable, from these we end up with two viable options that are then compared)
Figure \ref{fig:writing:coverage} visually illustrates an approach for making sure that everything gets covered. In this particular scenario, there are two aspects to consider. For the first aspect a number of choices has to be made. The first can be split into four different options. By evaluating these we find that only the last one could be viable. There is no need to consider the dead ends, but given the last option, another choice appears, of which the first and the last option could be viable. We need to follow both of these. Each of them are associated with a new choice with multiple potential options. We end up with two potential paths through this decision tree. Likewise, the second aspect ends up with two potential paths. We now need to combine these. We do by considering every combination of these. Of the for combinations one turns out to be a dead end. For each of the remaining three potential paths there is a last choice, and that leaves two potentially viable paths. A final comparison is made and a winning path is chosen. This path represent the set of choices that went into best path through the entire space, and these are the choices we continue with.

% serialize to text
This example contains a significant amount of complexity\idx{Complexity}. Visually, it is easy to get an overview of, but the text may end up taking 10+ pages. And then it can be hard to keep track. To help the reader you should consider how this should be serialized\idx{Serialization} and mapped to sections, subsections, paragraphs and even sentences. You may even wish to add something like figure \ref{fig:writing:coverage} as an index. If you have space for it, consider expanding each node to include a headline.

\section{Pieces}

\subsection{Contributions}

% intro: why do we write? to make contributions of insights, more text does not equal more contribution, neither does text quality, value does, you have to think about how you bring value
\idx{Contribution}Why do people bother to write reports? They do it to packetize contributions of insights into an easily consumable format. More text does not equal more contribution. While this is also the case for text\idx{Text quality} quality, that text quality does affect how readily available those contributions are. The contributions come from the value\idx{Value} that your insights\idx{Insight} bring. Your report is here as a media to carry these contributions. You should use this to anchor everything you place in your report.

% identify problem, analyze problem, propose solution to problem, check mark for each
So, what constitutes such a contribution? Anything that could bring value to the reader. However, you should look out for opportunities to cover the following and check them off if you can:
\begin{itemize}
  \descitem{Problem identification}\idxx{Problem!Identification}{Problem identification} The contribution leads to the reader being aware of something that needs attention.
  \descitem{Problem analysis}\idxx{Problem!Analysis}{Problem identification} The contribution brings new insights into an established problem.
  \descitem{Solution proposition}\idxx{Solution!Proposition}{Solution proposition} The contribution describes a way of dealing with an established problem and details the tradeoffs made.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Definitions}

Over time, any domain of even modest complexity will develop a vocabulary\idx{Vocabulary}; that is, terminology for expressing domain-relevant information. This allows domain experts to communicate quickly and efficiently, and that leaves more time to tackle the problem itself. The terminology of a BSc/MSc project falls into two categories:
\begin{enumerate}
  \descitem{Domain-Specific Terminology}\idxx{Terminology!Domain-specific}{Domain-specific terminology} Any project is related to one or more domains, and these come with established terminology. That is terminology that experts have agreed on. If you deviate from this, then people will have trouble understanding you. The term \textsl{variable}, for instance, is well established. If you start calling it something different (e.g., a box), then the recipients of your communication will assume that you are talking about something else. So, you need to be away of the prevailing terminology within relevant domains and adopt this.
  \descitem{Project-Specific Terminology}\idxx{Terminology!Project-specific}{Project-specific terminology} Most projects reach a level of nontriviality where concepts are introduced, and you have a need to refer to these. That means that you have to define them. By doing so, you construct a terminology foundation for your project that allows you to talk about it. This should be done explicitly with consistent formatting so that attention is drawn to it. That could be accomplished like this:
\end{enumerate}

\begin{terminology}
  We define the \termname{lookup latency} as the time penalty incurred by looking up the definition in the database.
\end{terminology}

\subsection{Floats}

% intro: what, examples (figure, table, code listing), refs are necessary
\idx{Floats} A float is a piece of the report that you allow the layouter\idx{Layouter} to place on your behalf. You don't have to care about it being broken up across multiple pages and you get a number that you can use to refer to it through. This is beneficial when you need to refer to it from multiple places in the document. In \LaTeX\idxx{LaTeX@\LaTeX}{\LaTeX}, there are a number of predefined float types (figure, table and code listing springs to mind), and you can define your own. The floats are also presented with a caption and stand out from the normal text.

% refs and context
No matter where the float ends up, you will have to refer to it by number\idxx{Floats!Referencing}{Referencing floats}. The text should always be written in such a manner that it is optional to look at the float. You must explicitly point out what you want the reader to take away from it. In the same way, the floats should make sense without locating the text that refers to them.

% preference
There are different schools of thought with regards to which kinds to floats\idxx{Floats!Types of}{Types of floats} to use. If you have a lot of figures and tables, it might make sense to use these environments so that they end up categorized in a list of figures and a list of tables. Typically, I prefer to use figures for everything. This solves the issue where you have to turn a lot of pages to figure out if you need to go forward or backward in order to find a particular float.

% example
Usually, floats works best when they are allowed to be placed\idxx{Floats!Placement of}{Placement of floats} at the top of a page, the bottom of a page and to fill up a whole page. In \LaTeX, this is accomplished this way:
\begin{minted}[breaklines]{latex}
\begin{figure}[tbp]
  \ldots
  \caption{Description of figure.}
  \label{fig:art:floats}
\end{figure}
\end{minted}

% short captions
Sometimes the caption\idxx{Floats!Caption}{Caption} will naturally take up more space than fits nicely into an entry into the list of figures. The solution is to add a shorter, abbreviated, version that can be used for this purpose. That can be done like this:
\begin{minted}[breaklines]{latex}
\caption[Short caption]{Long caption}
\end{minted}

% landscape mode
At times, a figure may be too complex to be readable in normal (i.e., portrait\idx{Portrait}) orientation\idx{Orientation}. In \LaTeX\ it is easy to scale and rotate elements. To put the contents of a figure in landscape\idx{Landscape} mode use something like this:
\begin{minted}[breaklines]{latex}
\begin{figure}[tbp]
  \begin{center}
    \scalebox{0.7}{
      \rotatebox{90}{
        \ldots
      }
    }
  \end{center}
  \caption{Description of figure that is rotated and scaled.}
  \label{fig:art:floats:landscape}
\end{figure}
\end{minted}

\subsection{Inline Enumerations}

When presenting a choice, we may want to list the consequences of that choice. Similarly, when reasoning about something, we may want to list a number of premises that all hold. We could use bullet points, but that breaks up the paragraph, and thus the flow. Figure \ref{fig:art:pieces:inlineenum:bnf} formalizes an inline enumeration construct that preserves the flow of the text. Here, \textsl{\$text} should be replaced by some text, and \textsl{\$num} by increasing numbers (I prefer lowercase roman numerals). The following is a concrete example of its use.

% example
\begin{center}
  \begin{minipage}{0.9\textwidth}
    \quoted{For the service to stay available we need (i) robust access to the DBMS, (ii) support for hot updates, and (iii) enough processing power to handle requests from both this service and the periodic backup service.}
  \end{minipage}
\end{center}

\subsection{Citations}

% why we cite
Each statement we make represent some thoughts. If those thoughts are yours, then you should get credit\idx{Credit} for them. If they are not, then you need to \textsl{give} credit. Otherwise, you will be stealing their work. Conveniently, this mechanism also allows you to not build up your argument from zero. Zero being the level that is generally accepted as truth amongst your peers.

\begin{inspiration}{Isaac Newton\idxx{Newton, Isaac}{Isaac Newton}\cite{Solr-dc-9792}}
  \quoted{If I have seen further it is by standing on the shoulders of Giants.}
\end{inspiration}

% when we cite
Every statement must be mapped to an owner. If a statement is not explicitly mapped to someone else, then you are the owner and it is your responsibility to argue for its correctness. If the owner is someone else, then credit need to be given. This is where we use citations. It is, however, still your responsibility to consider the credibility of the source, and to make sure that the full context of the source material is applicable in the situation where you cite it.

% how we cite
There are a number of ways to cite:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Adding a reference to a concept (e.g., an abbreviation). It is rarely done, and is often better accomplished through a footnote (e.g., with a link). This is done by adding the reference just after the mention of the concept:
    \\
    \mintinline{latex}{The ACM\cite{acm} publishes many articles.}
  \item \label{enum:writing:citations:support} Adding a reference in support of a statement. This is done by adding the reference at the end of the statement (before the period):
    \\
    \mintinline{latex}{The Earth is flat\cite{source}.}
  \item  \label{enum:writing:citations:natural} Natural references. This is done by putting the reference in place of a person:
    \\
    \mintinline{latex}{According to \cite{source} the Earth is flat.}
\end{enumerate}
I usually prefer \ref{enum:writing:citations:support} over \ref{enum:writing:citations:natural} due to its compactness and the separation between message and documentation. It allows me -- as a reader -- to not pay attention to the references, and yet they are still around should I need them. Multiple references can also be given:
\begin{minted}{latex}
A number of the surveyed papers conclude that the Earth is
flat\cite{paper1,paper13,paper16}.
\end{minted}

% what can be cited
Anything can be cited, but all citations are not equally useful. A citation is a reference. It allows the reader to look up the source of the information, verify that it says what you say it says, and evaluate how trustworthy it is. For this to work, it needs to be available to you. Ideally it should be published and without any form of access restriction. But you may have to refer to things that simply don't have that property. Many research papers are paywalled\idx{Paywall}. That is a step down. Maybe some document is published internally in some organization, but still necessary for documenting the decisions you have made. That is worse, but some people can still follow it. It could also be an insight that you received through a private\idx{Private correspondence} correspondence. That is pretty bad, but it can still be verified if you write who was at the other end of that correspondence. And if this insight way key to your project, then you need a way to refer to it.

\section{Questions}

\idx{Questions} A good writing technique is to pose and answer relevant questions. This makes it explicit that you have seen a particular aspect of the problem and considered it. It also helps drive forward the narrative of the report. Good questions include:

\begin{itemize}
  \descitem{From a scientific point of view, why does it matter?} This is a way of justifying\idx{Justification} diving into a certain area. If you have a good answer to that question, then you naturally have a go ahead \ldots\ as long as that science is within relevance of the project and doesn't \textsl{overpower} the other aspects of the work.
  \descitem{What is the underlying fundamental mechanism?} This is a vehicle for exploring what the \textsl{active ingredient}\idxx{Ingredient!Active}{Active ingredient} is; figuring out what it is that makes it work. The value in knowing this comes from gaining the ability to search for alternatives that implement the same mechanism (and thus should exhibit similar behavior).
\end{itemize}

\section{Anti-Patterns}

Anti-patterns are generalizations of behaviors which have negative consequences and should be avoided. In this case the patterns are textural. Many of the patterns described in this section have commonalities and most are the result of the writer not giving the text the attention that it deserves. Once you have written a sentence (and for that matter a paragraph), you should take a step back, and ask yourself the questions:
\begin{itemize}
  \item What does the reader know at this point?
  \item Are there any logical implications that are not supported?
  \item Are there any unnecessarily convoluted sentence constructs?
  \item Are there any potential for misunderstanding?
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Use-Before-Definition}

One of the more frustrating experiences of a reader is to read a text that refers to concepts or notions that have not been introduced. Another is when the text later on defines that thing. This is the wrong order; first define, then use. A compiler would complain, and so will a human.

\subsection{Overuse of Utilize}

% definition
Less experienced writers will often write \say{utilize}\idx{Utilize} at any opportunity, likely because it sounds fancy. The word is clearly related to \say{use}, but what does it really mean? It means \say{to make use of}, or to \say{put into (good) use}. So, it is just as related to \say{usage} as it is to \say{use}. Think of it as relating to \say{utilization}.

% vs use: use is almost always better
Technically, \say{use} is usually interchangeable with \say{utilize}. However, \say{utilize} is wider in meaning and thus significantly harder to read. So, when interchangeable, \say{utilize} is almost always the worse option. Until you have a good reason not to, just use \say{use}.

% there are exceptions, define exception class

\subsection{Reason-Therefore-Reason}

% Because of the "Therefore" you already have a reason and that reason will appear -- to the reader -- to be in conflict with what comes after the "as" of the last sentence.
A frequent annoyance when reading dissertations is sentences that start out with a something, continues with a \say{therefore} and finished with another reason.  Because of the \say{therefore}, the \say{something} will act as a reason and the expressed reason will appear -- to the reader -- to be in conflict with that \say{something}. If you have two reasons, then express it as \say{Due to the combination of $R_1$ and $R_2$, \ldots}. If one of the reasons is really an intermediary step, then it could be expressed as \quoted{As $R_1$, $R_2$ and therefore \ldots}.

\subsection{Sentence Repetition}

% First introducing a general statement, and then providing two examples
It is common, in a dissertation, to see the essence of a sentence repeated twice, or even trice. This gives the impression that the author did a poor job of organizing their thoughts, likely due to last-minute stress. But the reasons may be different; perhaps the author has been torn between two ways of telling the story. Often this can be overcome by first introducing a general statement, and then explicitly providing a concrete example or two.

\subsection{Two Paragraphs for Single Purpose}

% This paragraph serves exactly the same purpose as the previous one, and as the saying goes: There can be only one!
A paragraph\idxx{Purpose!Paragraph}{Paragraph purpose} should have a purpose, and two successive paragraphs should have different purposes. Having two paragraphs with the same purpose makes for bad story telling. As the saying goes:

\begin{inspiration}{Connor MacLeod\idx{MacLeod, Connor}\cite{highlander}}
  \quoted{There can be only one!}
\end{inspiration}

\subsection{Should Without a Question}

% Leading with a "should" tells the reader that you are asking a question. If you flip it around (i.e., research should) makes a concluding statement.
In a BSc/MSc dissertation, it is frequent to come across a sentence that starts with the word \say{should} but never gets around to posing a question. That leading \say{should} tells the reader that you are asking a question, and when that question never comes, the reader gets confused. If you flip it around -- as in \say{research should} -- this it becomes a concluding statement.

\subsection{Triple Linespacing}

Increased the line spacing\idx{Linespacing} is something used by public school teachers to write grammar notes on print. You are expected to write grammatically correct text when you reach the university level so we don't do that. Please stick to a reasonable line spacing. In reality, increasing the line spacing makes the report appear \textsl{thin}.

\subsection{Avoidance of First Person Pronouns}
\idx{First person pronouns}

% problem
When reporting on some work that has been done, the focus should be on what has been done and not who did it. It probably shouldn't matter who did it. Focusing on that when it doesn't matter detracts from what was done.

% focus
Many students have at some point in their studies heard some version of this. Most seem to have made a mental note of never using \say{I} or \say{we}. While this will often avoid potential trouble, it is not really the words that are problematic, but rather specific uses of them. And avoiding them altogether will, at times, force one to replace them with something else.

% problematic fix
Instead of phrasing \quoted{we decided to} I often see students write \quoted{the group decided to}. But \quoted{the group} is third person, and it forces the reader to pose the question: Which group? An inconsistency has been introduced.

% point and fix fix
In short, that replacement has to be equivalent. But if it is equivalent, then why does it matter? In this specific case it doesn't. To understand why, we need to realize that there are two critically different classes of scenarios:
\begin{enumerate}
  \descitem{Focus belongs on the action} When it is irrelevant who did it, it is usually better to leave it out. Example: \quoted{After 3 seconds, the heat was removed} is clearer (and more relevant) than \quoted{After 3 seconds, I removed the heat}.
  \descitem{Focus belongs on the decision} When it is important who owns a decision (and thus deserves credit or blame) then we need to know who, and it shouldn't be avoided. Example: \quoted{We decided not to implement the change} explicitly assigns ownership to the decision while \quoted{It was decided not to implement the change} does not.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Since-Since Constellation}

% importance of providing arguments, single construction, two arguments, argument relationships (and/or/chain) with examples, under no circumstances the since-since constellation
Arguments make up a large part of the essence of a report. Frequently a \idx{Since construction}since-construction is used: \say{$S_1$, since $S_2$}. This means that $S_1$ holds because the reason ($S_2$) holds and this construction works when $S_2$ obviously holds. But sometimes the reason is complex.

This complexity can take the form of a logical and ($S_1$, since $S_{2a}$ and $S_{2b}$), a logical or ($S_1$, since either $S_{2a}$ or $S_{2b}$), or a chain\idxx{Reason!Chain of}{Chain of reason} of reasoning. That chain of reasoning is harder to put down on paper in a reasonable way.

The form \say{$S_1$, since $S_{2a}$, since $S_{2b}$} is highly confusing as it is unclear where the hidden\idxx{Parentheses!Hidden}{Hidden parentheses} parentheses are placed. This constellation should be avoided. The easy way out is to split it into two sentences. Another construct that often works is \say{Because $S_{2a}$ then $S_{2b}$ and thus $S_1$}. If the chain of reasons is even longer, then one should go with multiple sentences.

\chapter{Introduction Section}
\label{chap:intro}

% expand on project description
Your introduction\idx{Introduction} from the project description should represent a good starting point. Use it as a starting point. As you progress through the project you can expand on it, and -- if necessary -- make some adjustments as you get wiser\idx{Wisdom}. The goal is to end up with a text that tells a coherent and valuable story. You may find that this requires you to adjust the problem statement. You are allowed to do that as long as the adjustments are rooted in new insights into the domain rather than a wish to deal with something radically different. Adjusting the title is a bit harder. It requires paperwork.

% consider adding a "report structure"
Often, you will see reports having a \quoted{Report Structure}\idx{Report structure} subsection to the introduction section. It is by no means a requirement, but it does give you an opportunity to describe the overall report structure to the reader. Typically, this is done in a single paragraph through approximately one sentence per top-level section or chapter. Make sure that there is a flow to the text, and -- as a bonus -- consider adding some reasoning for the layout that is rooted in the problem.

\section{Stakeholder Interviews}

% deeper understanding of the actual problem, to properly describe the structure of the problem and how different aspect affect different parts of the organization (both for qualifying problem structure, and for understanding underlying tradeoffs), cover as many aspects as possible (argued through stakeholder roles)
To get a deeper understanding of the actual problem we often perform stakeholder interviews\idx{Stakeholder interview}. The goal is to properly describe the structure of the problem, and highlight how various aspects of the problem affects different parts of the organization. This allows us to qualify structural elements of the problem and understand underlying tradeoffs\idx{Tradeoff}. To accomplish this, we should go for coverage of as many aspects as possible. That coverage can be argued through interviews of of people from a wide list of stakeholder roles.

% questions: questions need to be prepared, should cover all relevant aspects
Before the interviews you must have prepared a framework\idxx{Stakeholder interview!Framework}{Framework} for the interview, and a list of questions. Do you interview stakeholders individually, or do you pit opposing roles against each other? You have a limited amount of time. Which questions will give you the most value within the allotted time? And how much time should you ask of your interviewees?

% fully structured
The perhaps most immediate strategy is to come up with a long list of very specific questions. Questions, which build of your knowledge of the field and go straight to the point. They might even be yes/no type of questions. You provide a tight structure and guide the interviewee neatly through it all. That is what is referred to as a \textsl{structured} interview\idx{Structured interview}. Its success depends on you having a deep enough understanding of the field and the stakeholders. In reality, you are unlikely to have that level of understanding, and the responses you get will be limited to your previous understanding of the field. Little will be learned.

% level of structure: structured as immediate choice, the other extreme, semistructured being wide, argue for the level of structure
At the opposite end of the scale we have an \textsl{unstructured} interview\idx{Unstructured interview}, where you make sure that you never lead the interviewee. By not leading the, you make sure that they get to make up their own minds and bring up the things they really think matter. However, there is little reason to think that what they bring up is of any interest to you. The rest of the scale is covered by various degrees of \textsl{semistructured} interviews\idx{Semistructured interview}, and this is obviously where you want to be. This part of the scale is, however, still very wide, and it is up to you to argue where exactly you fall and why. When, and to which degree, do you force an aspect into the conversation?

% recording and referencing
Recording\idxx{Stakeholder interview!Recording}{Recording} the interview, will free you of the job of having to take notes \textsl{during} the interview. This, obviously, requires the concent of all participants. Ideally, you will hand in the recording along with your report and simply refer to timestamps in the interview. However, not all stakeholders are willing to participate on such terms and then you will have to find a common ground. Video is useful to catch the context of the discussion (e.g., a whiteboard). Some tools provide convening features\footnote{Please write me if you have positive experience with some other tool, and I will add it here}:
\begin{itemize}
  \descitem{Teams}\idxx{Microsoft!Teams}{Microsoft Teams} allows you to record a video meeting, and to transcribe it according to a user-selected language (e.g., Danish).
  \descitem{Word}\idxx{Microsoft!Word}{Microsoft Word} has a function that allows you to upload an audio file, and then it will generate a timestamped transcription (both English and Danish). Furthermore, it can detect unique voices that you can name.
\end{itemize}

% upskilling may be necessary, so it might be necessary to investigate some related work first
In order to act as a qualified interviewer it may be necessary to upskill\idx{Upskilling} before the interview. This usually requires investigating some related work, and may result in the related work section more naturally being placed earlier in the report than the stakeholder interviews. In such cases -- where the work does not cleanly map to a simple sequential order -- it becomes a matter of minimizing badness and prepping the reader for this.

\chapter{Related Work Section}

% purpose
\idx{Related work} You are rarely expected to start building your solution from the ground up. Instead, you should \quoted{stand on the shoulders of giants}\cite{newton1959correspondence} or, at least, learn from them. If your project touch on areas that your knowledge doesn't obviously cover then you need to build up that knowledge, and you may need to do so in several different areas. For instance, if you will be working on a way of visualizing a large amount of graph data, you should look into the state of the art withing both graph visualization and graph storage, and perhaps also the interaction between those. One way of gaining such insights is a literature review. In the graph visualization example you would perform two or three literature reviews.

\section{Goals}
\label{sec:relatedwork:questions}

% questions
The first step is to come up with a set of questions that you seek to answer. For each of these you construct search queries that are to be resolved against literature search engines to form the basis of a literature review. By dealing with each question independently, you (i) avoid the situation where you need to map individual articles back to a specific question and (ii) have a direct way of adapting the process to produce a reasonable number of articles for each topic.

% completion criteria
But, what is a reasonable number of articles? From a practical perspective, you will need to be able to read them; at least at some level of depth. That is more of a practical restriction though. A successful literature review covers a question to completion. If you know very little about the subject to begin with, then you may need to go for coverage. You do so by going wide. You can argue for completeness, when you have passed the point of diminishing returns. If you already know something about the subject, then you can use this to inform a more directed effort.

\section{Trust}

% always critical reception of source material, especially when not peer reviewed, alternative sources, wikipedia example (with ref to discussion section), adjusting the strength of a statement

\section{Building Blocks}
\label{sec:realtedwork:buildingblocks}

\subsection{Source}

% organizations
Scientific papers are usually published by organizations. These organizations specialize in research covering specific areas. Some have a broader target areas that others. In this respect, software engineering -- as we see it at SDU -- is not really all that popular outside of Denmark. In the US, for instance, \quoted{software engineer}\idx{Software engineer} is a title that is being held through employment by someone who studied computer science\idx{Computer science} (da: datalogi). The closest \textsl{large troves} of scientific papers are rooted in computer science.

% search engines: acm, ieee, elsevier, aggregate search engines (have to described), problematic search engines, venues outside of the big organizations (e.g., CIDR)
As such, the most relevant organizations are -- in order of decreasing significance -- ACM\footnote{\url{https://dl.acm.org}}, IEEE\footnote{\url{https://ieeexplore.ieee.org}}, and Elsevier\footnote{\url{https://www.elsevier-elibrary.com}}. They each have their own search engines with links in the footnotes. Access to these can be gained through the SDU library webpage\footnote{\url{https://www.sdu.dk/en/bibliotek}}. There are sites that provides \textsl{incomplete} cross-organizational indexes (e.g., ResearchGate\footnote{\url{https://www.researchgate.net}} and Google Scholar\footnote{\url{https://scholar.google.com}}). Be careful using those as it is hard to reason about the completeness of the search results. Lastly, there are venues outside the big organizations. These are usually fairly narrow in terms of area. A good example of these is CIDR\footnote{\url{https://www.cidrdb.org}}, a conference in \quoted{data systems research}. This conference is not associated with a broader organization, and yet the level is as high as it gets.

% search queries: search engines, query languages with set operations (union ↦ OR, intersection ↦ AND), constructing the search query (purpose, strategy)

% domain connection: problem/approach separation example
Not all questions are equally linked to a domain. Common scenarios include (but may not be limited to):
\begin{itemize}
  \item Some questions only exists within a very narrow domain. Then it is strictly limited to the domain and filtering shouldn't make much of a difference (if we are correct in this assumption, that is).
  \item Some questions make sense in multiple domains, only one of which we care about. In this case, filtering will make a whole lot of sense.
  \item Some questions are independent of domain. As an example, if I want to evaluate the scalability of a webapp for streaming videos of kittens I might look for a workload generator that can throw requests at it. In my search for such generators I certainly don't care if they were designed with videos \textsl{of kittens} in mind. It may make a difference if they are designed with videos in mind, but -- depending on the specific need -- it might be enough for the workload generator simply to operate at HTTP level and send REST commands.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Filtering}

% problem

% criteria list
When filtering, you need an \textsl{inclusion criteria}\idx{Inclusion criteria}. This is some complex function over relevant criteria, including (but not limited to):
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Language (e.g., only articles in English).
  \item Venue (e.g., only papers published to conferences or journals of a certain level\footnote{Conference ranks could be taken from here: \url{http://www.conferenceranks.com}})
  \item Paper title
  \item Paper abstract
  \item Paper introduction
\end{enumerate}
In describing this, it might be useful to introduce the notion of an \textsl{exclusion criteria}\idx{Exclusion criteria}. Do make sure that there is no ambiguity regarding how it is applied.

\subsection{Sorting}

% problem+purpose

% criteria list
\begin{itemize}
  \item Venue Rating
  \item Citation count
  \item Date of publication
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Snowballing}

\idx{Snowballing} Papers come with references. If a paper is relevant chances are that some of the references are relevant as well. Follow these, and repeat the process. When documenting the process, it is important to describe this recursive process is concluded. This is known as snowballing.

\subsection{Reverse Snowballing}

\idx{Reverse snowballing} Reverse snowballing is when you search the other way: You have a relevant paper, and want to know which papers refer to it. This will yield newer papers.

\subsection{Author Tracking}

At times you fill find that a certain author has produced multiple papers of relevance. That author may have done other research that resulted in other relevant papers, and it might be worthwhile to investigate whether this is the case.

\subsection{Sinks}

\section{Documentation}

% purpose, process documentation, coverage, repeatability, credibility
Simply reading and referencing a large number of papers does not build trust in the result. Understanding how that result came to be has the potential to. It allows the reader to evaluate the coverage and credibility of the results, and -- if done right -- provides repeatability by representing a recipe documenting how the literature review was conducted.

% figure: configuration/pipeline, at each step of the pipeline
You ended up producing a configuration of a DAG\idx{DAG} of building blocks (from section \ref{sec:realtedwork:buildingblocks}). A natural starting point for documenting that graph is to visualize it. Which building blocks did you use when, and for which purpose? How many references did you have at the output end of each node? This helps putting the effectiveness of each node in perspective.

\section{Presentation}

% proposed structure: follow the questions, one subsection per question, if few papers then one per paragraph
The overall strategy of presentations should be to follow and structure according to the questions (from section \ref{sec:relatedwork:questions}). One subsection per question is a good start. If you end up having a small number of papers (e.g., 4), then you have the option of simply adding one paragraph per paper covering:
\begin{itemize}
  \item A brief summary of the paper highlighting the relevance.
  \item Takeaways in the form of insights that needs to be considered for the project.
\end{itemize}

% if many papers then write a text presenting the space in a structured manner, themes, add references to the papers collaborating each point, quotes can be added.
That strategy does not scale with the number of papers though. Another option is to structure according to themes across the papers reviewed. Add a subsection per theme containing a summary of the domain of that these. Here you can add references to the reviewed papers to support statements, and even quotes if that is the best way of presenting a point.

% theme figure: tree structure with bitvector for which times are covered by which papers

\section{Example}

\subsection{Article Discovery}
\idxx{Discovery, Article}{Article discovery}

Figure \ref{fig:relatedwork:example:process} illustrates the process for discovering relevant articles.

% initial search results
In order to cover the necessary areas, we have constructed $n$ queries ($Q_1$ through $Q_2$). Each of these were formatted in the appropriate query language and used at an appropriate subset of $m$ venues ($V_1$ through $V_m$)\footnote{The specific mapping should be documented.}. Each of these combinations resulted in a set of articles which (combined) were used as the initial seed for the priority queue.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% Requirements
\chapter{Requirements Section}

% evaluation
\idx{Requirements} The requirements will eventually have to be evaluated. Before leaving the requirement capture phase of the project you should consider how you will evaluate each requirement. This can also function as a sanity check. So, before moving on, you should skim section \ref{sec:eval} on evaluation.

% synthesis

% vs goals
In projects that are explorative\idx{Explorative project} in nature, it often makes sense to think of requirements as \quoted{goals}\idx{Goals} or attractive qualities. That is, unlike a typical requirement, failing to achieve it does represent a failure to reach the project goals. Instead, it is something that we strive to reach, and it is a project goal to explore to which degree we can do so. As the number of such goals increase so does the dimensionality of the space that has to be explored, and the resources needed to do so.

\section{Elicitation}

% definition: abstraction (at which level should the requirementsbe defined? dependency om problem and vision horizon)

% sources

% problems: scope, problem understanding, volatility

\section{Functionality}

% intro
Often, requirements are split into those that are functional in nature, and those that are not. In this dichotomy, functional\idxx{Requirement!Functional}{Functional requirements} requirements relates to \textsl{what} the system under construction should be capable of doing, and non-functional\idxx{Requirement!Non-functional}{Non-functional requirements} requirements relates to \textsl{how} or \textsl{under which conditions} it should be able to deliver these capabilities. On the surface, this may seem quite clear-cut, but in reality the distinction often becomes muddied up.

\section{Tradeoffs}

% intro

% plane examples: some of the best examples, altitude <-> weight (U-2), altitude*speed <-> weight (SR-71), practicality <-> stealth (F-117A), reference, focus on when he states "it didn't matter"
The military airplane industry provides some great examples of tradeoffs. \idx{Lockheed}Lockheed's Skunk\idx{Skunk Works} Works is a particularly rich with such examples.
When tasked with the design of what became the U-2\idxx{U-2 spy plane}{U-2} spy plane (with altitude requirements), they realized that they were dealing with a fundamental tradeoff between weight and altitude, and because of this they began measuring features (e.g., equipment) in altitude. In that respect the cost of a self-balancing landing gear was deemed too expensive.
For the SR-71\idxx{SR-71 spy plane}{SR-71} the requirements on altitude resulted in them trading the practicalities of a built-in starter motor for an external one. And the requirements on speed of meant that the surface temperature of the craft dictated several design decisions that caused the final plane to drip fuel while on the ground and barely be able to lift off with enough fuel to get off the ground and hook up with a tanker aircraft.
In order to achieve a low degree of radar observability (aka stealth) using the computational power available to them at the time, they had to create an aerodynamically horrible design (the F-117A\idxx{F-117A attack aircraft}{F-117A}), and find solutions to make it stay in the air anyways.
According to most definitions these were terrible aircrafts. This was the result of trading off what needed to be traded off in order to fulfill the requirements. In doing so, they created some of the most groundbreaking designs. This was possible because the set of requirements had left the designspace\idxx{Design space!Nonempty}{Nonempty design space} was nonempty.
If you don't know the stories behind these planes, do yourself a favour and watch this \cite{skunkworks2017} presentation by Nickolas\idxx{Means, Nickolas}{Nickolas Means} Means. If in a rush, focus on the 13:25-46:26 segment. Whenever the presenter states \say{because it just did't matter} he is referring to a quality that was traded off.

\section{Unbounded Non-Functionalitites}

\begin{inspiration}{Aslak Johansen\idxx{Johansen, Aslak}{Aslak Johansen}}
  \textbf{Aslak's first law:} \quoted{An unbounded requirement will consume all design space allowed by any related tradeoffs}
\end{inspiration}

% problem: it is natural to come up with absolute functional requirements, it should be scalable/how much/forever, but there are consequences to this
When it comes to non-binary properties\idxx{Property!Non-binary}{Non-binary properties}, people often have trouble differentiating between what the actual requirement is and what they want. It is natural to end up with absolute (aka unbounded)\idxx{Requirement!Unbounded}{Unbounded requirement} functional requirements. For instance, there is something very uncomfortable about bounding scalability; especially if you don't have a good feel for it. Determining that boundary can be a mini-project in and of itself. However, not doing it also comes with consequences.

% that requirement likely plays into multiple tradeoffs, an absolute requirement will force an extreme resolution of each tradeoff it is involved in (however the magnitude of the real-world impact), if multiple unbounded requirements exists then they are likely to counteract each other in some tradeoffs and thus leave the system architect with no valid path forward (if both are top priority, then none of them are top priority)
Most performance-related requirements play into a number of tradeoffs\idx{Tradeoff}. If such a requirement is unbounded it will force an extreme resolution of each tradeoff it is involved in (however, the magnitude of the real-world impact). Such resolutions will often be costly in other properties while providing little benefit in the dimension of the property the requirement relates to. If multiple unbounded requirements exists then they are likely to counteract each other in some tradeoffs and thus leave the system architect with no valid or good path forward: If both are top priority, then none of them are top priority.

% priority doesn't help much: it is also an absolute concept, it only make some unbounded requirements less unbounded, example: a situation where we need to maximize availability as first priority and response time as second priority (given the involved tradeoffs, the "right" solution might result in a horrible response time because the availability requirement is stronger and eats consumes all the design space it touches)
One might prioritize requirements\idxx{Requirement!Priority}{Requirement priority} then. But as priority is also an absolute concept it doesn't help much. It only makes some unbounded requirements \textsl{weakly} unbounded. For instance, lets imagine a situation where we are building a system where we need to maximize availability as first priority and response time as second priority. Given the involved tradeoffs the \say{right} solution might result in an absolutely horrible response time because the availability requirement is stronger and consumes all the design space it touches.

% back to the roots: a requirement is just that, minimum acceptable criteria, that leaves room for system architects to navigate the involved tradeoffs and maximize value, if you want to guide those architects you should provide a list of attractive qualities.
When such requirements manifest it is important to go back to the roots. A requirements is just that; a minimum acceptable criteria. Sticking to that leaves room for system architects to navigate the involved tradeoffs and maximize value. If you want to provide those architects with more guidance, you should provide a list of attractive qualities.

\section{MoSCoW Method}

% brief description: not an analysis
The MoSCoW Method\idx{MoSCoW} is a technique used to understand the importance placed by stakeholders on individual requirements. It introduces four categories of priorities (with grossly simplified definitions):
\begin{enumerate}
  \descitem{Must have}\idx{Must have} Critical for success of the product. Note that the success of your project is not dependent on producing a successful product; there are other ways of providing value to the stakeholders (e.g., by showing that it is impossible to produce such a product).
  \descitem{Should have}\idx{Should have} Important, but critical to the viability of the product (it can provide value without these requirements).
  \descitem{Could have}\idx{Could have} Desirable, but fulfillment should be weighed against required effort.
  \descitem{Won't have}\idx{Won't have} Would provide value but won't be considered. This essentially makes it a non-requirement\idxx{Requirement!Non}{Non-Requirement}.
\end{enumerate}

% rationale: lack of analytical rationale for ranking
In and of itself, MoSCoW is simply a categorical ranking scheme. It does not provide an analytical framework for coming up with a rationale for such a ranking. This does not mean that no rationale is needed. You should provide that rationale as a textual argument.

% simply prioritization: does not mean that "would" don't need to be covered, example (don't choose a framework that cannot support all would's)
Do note that a MoSCoW prioritization is a priority of eventual requirements\idxx{Requirement!Eventual}{Eventual requirements}. That is, requirements that, sometime in a future, should be fulfilled. Whether or not you use an iterative approach you should consider your project to represent the beginning of a (potentially iterative) lifecycle. You may not end up implementing all the \textit{coulds}. Then that job will be left to the next (at handin time yet unrealized) iteration of the project. So you still need to make sure that implementing those requirements won't require scrapping the base design. It is thus critical to either (i) make sure you don't end up in a situation where a design choice (e.g., a choice of framework) paints you into a corner where it becomes impossible to fulfill a requirement, or (ii) be up-front about which requirement you choose to reject and what your reasoning for doing so is.

\section{Testability}

\idx{Testability} I often come across requirements like \quoted{The system should be responsive}. On the surface it appears fine, even sane. However, it is not testable. There is no agreement as to what it means for a system to be \quoted{responsive}. It is what is sometimes referred to as a \quoted{bad requirement}\idxx{Requirement!Bad}{Bad requirement}.

Usually, we have requirements because we need something to evaluate a resulting system against. For this purpose, the above mentioned requirement is useless, and it is your problem not spotting it in due time.

Sometimes this kind of problematic requirement can be \quoted{leveled up}. In this particular case it might be clear that the \quoted{responsiveness}\idx{Responsiveness} property relates to the users of the system. That, in and of itself, doesn't help us much, but it does give us something to work with: We could construct a system that exposes users to varying response times and ask them to rank\idxx{Ranking!Categorical}{Categorical ranking} different runs as either \quoted{responsive} or \quoted{not responsive}. That way we can \textsl{quantify}\idxx{Ranking}{Ranking} what it means to be responsive in this context.

\textbf{Note:} This would be part of the requirement analysis\idx{Requirement analysis}, as you will need a good understanding of the requirements before starting on the design.

\section{Evolution}

\section{Tradeoffs}

% definition: mutually exclusive qualities, 3-way, steps
At times we come across two (or more) desired qualities of the outcome of a software project that are mutually exclusive. That is, improving one comes at a cost in the other. This is known as a tradeoff\idx{Tradeoff}. If there are three such qualities, it is a 3-way tradeoff\idxx{Tradeoff!3-way}{3-way tradeoff}. At times one of these scales is discrete, and then some improvement may be possible to the other quality before triggering a \textsl{step} on the discrete scale. At other times the scales may be complex, and then the tradeoff will (likely) be complex as well.

\begin{inspiration}{Xander Harris\idxx{Harris, Xander}{Xander Harris}\cite{buffy_s7e4}}
%  Figuring out how to control your magic seems a lot like hammering a nail.
  ``\textsl{At the end of the hammer, you have the power, but no control. It takes, like, two strokes to hit the nail in, or you could hit your thumb.}
    
    \ldots
    
    \textsl{So you choke up. Control, but no power. It could take like ten strokes to knock the nail in. Power, control. It's a tradeoff.}''
\end{inspiration}

% fundamentality
If the tradeoff has its roots in the problem space\idx{Problem space}, then we refer to it as a \textsl{fundamental} tradeoff\idxx{Tradeoff!Fundamental}{Fundamental tradeoff}. While fundamental tradeoffs have to be accepted, they don't necessarily translate (directly) to the design space\idx{Design space}. Problem restrictions and design decisions may transform the tradeoff. It then looses its fundamental property, and might even cease to be a tradeoff.

% why it matters
The identification of tradeoffs -- inherent or artificial\idxx{Tradeoff!Artificial}{Artificial tradeoff} -- is key to understanding the problem space and reasoning about the solution space\idx{Solution space}. Therefore, be explicit about the tradeoffs you identify, and how you resolve them.

% absolute scalability example: unbounded goals eat all others in tradeoffs
Goals can often be mapped to such qualities. When such goals are \textsl{unbounded}\idxx{Goals!Unbounded}{Unbounded goal} seek to maximize a quality that in involved in a tradeoff, you have no room to navigate that tradeoff: It has to be resolved with this quality as the sole consideration. This typically makes solutions skewed to a ridiculous degree as every single choice that has a minute relevance for the quality has to be resolved in its favor. In other words, all other qualities involved in tradeoffs with this quality will suffer while you are likely to observe greatly diminishing returns\idx{Diminishing returns}. If you are unbounded goals that refers to two qualities that are involved in the same tradeoff, then it is likely impossible to create a solution that fulfills both. This is a bad spot to be in. You would need to evaluate the whole solution space, and argue for the least bad\idx{Badness} solution. Consider this when you design your requirements\idxx{Requirement!Unbounded}{Unbounded requirement}!

\section{Purpose}

% discussion: different approaches to the analysis/design separation

% competing design concepts: ... , granularity

% approach: design includes justification and documentation

% approach: design is documentation alone

\section{Figures}

% problem: complex figure that is unreadable on print
Figures are not included for show; they should have a purpose. Often a large and intricate class diagram\idx{Class diagram} is included: \quoted{Now we have documented out design}. That feels like a excuse. In reality, such figures are very hard to read, and even harder to wrap your head around. In such cases the diagram i scaled to fit an A4 page. However, a consequence of this is that the text is so small that it is barely readable, or worse. And because of the complexity of the systems that go into these projects they also represent an overload of information. This is not the way to document a design.

% many small (and clean) figures that each have a specific purpose
Instead, consider the system design from different aspects and granularities. Start by presenting the principal components of the system and how they relate to each other. If needed, each of these principal components can be outlined in separate figures. Then present the remaining (relevant) details through aspects; how does each of the underlying mechanisms work?

% details
Each of these figures should have exactly the details needed to tell the story you want to tell, and nothing else. If something is not necessary to tell the design story, then it would be an act of overfitting to make it a part of the design. Instead, leave that detail open to the implementation phase.

\section{Text}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% Implementation
\chapter{Implementation Section}

% expectation: you can program
At this point we expect you to be able to write code. Whether you used a \keywordname{for} or a \keywordname{while} loop to implement repetition is unlikely to peak our interest\footnote{Unless it actually makes a difference.}. With the software engineering BSc as a partial exception, we also expect you to be able to compose basic structures of logic and data to come up with a solution to a code problem.

% what we want to see
In general, what we want to see documented is extraordinary implementations. Anything that deviates from how the reader would naturally think about the solution space\idx{Solution space}. This could be a dispatch mechanism that has benefits to maintainability or efficiency.

% msc: 
As you transition through your education the focus shifts away from implementation and onto design and evaluation. In many types of MSc projects I don't expect to see any implementation details.

\section{Programming Language}

% by no you should have decided on a programming language paradigm, choose a language that is a good match for this
By now, you should have decided om a programming\idxx{Paradigm!Programming language}{Programming language}\index{Programming language} language paradigm, or at least have considered the different aspects. The next step is to choose a language that is a good match for this paradigm. Violating this is a common mistake.

% the python problem: scripting language with tuples, lists and maps as basic data structures, wasn't designed for OO and doesn't have strong OO properties, by forcing an OO mindset you will end with a poor mapping from concept to implementation (instead of playing to the strengths of the language)
Often, a group will choose Python\idx{Python} as their main programming language. This is a scripting language that relies of tuples, lists and maps as the basic data structures. It wasn't designed for object-orientation in mind and thus does not have strong object-oriented properties. By forcing an object-oriented mindset\idxx{Mindset!Object-oriented}{Object-oriented mindset} they will likely end up with a poor mapping from concept to implementation. Instead they should have chosen a language whose strengths played to the intended paradigm.

\section{Tuning}

\idx{Tuning} Often, software has parameters whose ideal values are non-obvious. This is something that is very common in some types of software and very rare in others. In order to properly evaluate the software these parameters need to be \textsl{tuned} first.

Such parameters are often used for:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Size of a buffer/queue/cache/batch.
  \item Frequency of polling/sampling.
  \item Lengths of timeouts.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% Evaluation
\chapter{Evaluation Section}
\label{sec:eval}

% intro:
\idx{Evaluation} When you have constructed your system, you have certainly achieved something. But at that point we know very little about \textsl{what} you have achieved. Does it work correctly? How well does it meet the requirements? To be able to make claims in these regards, you need an evaluation. What and how you need to evaluate depends on which kinds of claims\idx{Claim} you wish to make. At the end of the day the claims supported by your evaluation will define the success of the system. From a report perspective, that is.

% TODO: needs a rewrite:
My recommendation is for you to think the evaluation into the design so that you end up designing for evaluation. One benefit of that would be that your mental model of the evaluation process evolves along with the project. Another would be that that you end up having natural points for instrumentation\idx{Instrumentation} in the codebase that gives you exactly the kind of access that you need for your *ideal* evaluation.

\section{Criteria}

\subsection{Functionality}

% dealing with
From an evaluation perspective, functional requirements\idxx{Requirement!Functional}{Functional requirement} are trivial. Is the requirement fulfilled? It's a yes or no question. At times you will find that the answer is somewhere in the middle (and thus: No). In those cases, you should ask yourself whether the requirement is too loosely phrased. It may make sense to split it into two or three subrequirements and deal with them individually. In any case, you will have some explanation to do.

% change throughout the educations
The further along in your education the less focus there will be on functional requirements. In your BSc it is key. In your MSc will usually\footnote{This depends on project type.} need to be there, but the nonfunctional requirements is normally the more interesting side of the spectrum. In your PhD\idx{PhD}, unless you work is directly linked to functional requirements you just expect that part to be in place and focus on the nonfunctional ones.

\subsection{Correctness}

% definition: meaning

  \quoted{Doing linear scans over an associative array is like trying to club someone to death with a loaded Uzi.}
\end{inspiration}

% width
\idx{Performance evaluation} When you simply refer to \quoted{performance} you are referring to every single aspect of performance, and thus you are making a very wide statement. Verifying the correctness of such a statement would mean to verify it for all aspects of performance, relevant or not. That is usually a very labor-intensive task. Instead, you should consider whether you want that statement to actually cover all performance aspects.

% how performance may affect functional requirements and availability

\subsubsection{Latency}

% defining latency
Latency\idx{Latency} is the amount of time it takes to pass though some part of the system. As such there can be multiple relevant latencies associated with a system. Often, one focuses on the latency imposed by individual services exposed by the system. This is essentially measured by obtaining a timestamp\idx{Timestamp}, invoking the service, taking another timestamp, and then subtracting the first timestamp from the last. For evaluation purposes, it is thus important to define \textsl{which} latencies need to be evaluated. This can either be done through very explicit text (in order to avoid ambiguity\idx{Ambiguity}) or by visually highlighting certain points on a figure.

% dynamic properties, distribution as a function over load
The approach of taking a single measurement, however, does not account for dynamic properties of the involved components. Such dynamics can stem from a number of sources, including but not limited to:
\begin{itemize}
  \descitem{Resources under Load} Resources are limited, usually in multiple dimensions. Sometimes this limitation is gradual, and sometimes it is binary (e.g., if only one component can have access to it at a time). For instance:
    \begin{itemize}
      \item The performance of a \textsl{DBMS} will vary depending on the load. A higher load will result in a higher response time.
      \item The transfer rate of a \textsl{network link} depends on its utilization. If, for instance, a 1Gb/s link is under 90\% load then only 100Mb/s is left. Add to this a penalty of administration.
    \end{itemize}
  \descitem{Maintenance Operations} Operations that happens more or less regularly and has an effect on components of the system. For instance:
    \begin{itemize}
      \item A \textsl{scheduler}\idx{Scheduler} that shifts in and out code in order to give other code time. On a general purpose operating system, this is done at the kernel level to make sure that all OS processes get time and thus appear to run in parallel. Something similar happens when working with userspace threads.
      \item Most modern \textsl{garbage collectors}\idxx{Garbage collection!Stop-the-world}{Stop-the-world Garbage collection} use a \textsl{stop-the-world} algorithm like Mark-and-Sweep\idx{Mark-and-Sweep}. This causes pauses in execution and are generally considered a bad fit for time-critical problems (e.g., those involving video, audio or real-time).
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

% uncertainty of a single measurement, combined distributions, noise
Because of the inherent complexities of the systems that we want to investigate, we can't tell for sure which dynamics were at play during the collection of any single measurement. Instead, the underlying phenomena\idx{Phenomena characterization} can be characterized by a distribution\idx{Distribution}. Multiple measurements are needed to define that distribution. The more measurements we collect, the more rare events we will be able to capture. So, in order to determine how many measurements we need, we must consider the key events of the system, and how they interact to produce the final distribution. Finally, certain components have noisy latency. Even if the noise of all individual components is insignificant, at times the noise of the combination may add up to something significant.

% bad requirements
\idxx{Requirement!Bad}{Bad requirements}There a numerous horrible example of bad latency-related requirements. The worst is that \quoted{the system must have low latency}. This immediately forces a number of questions (for which the answers are defining for the outcome of the evaluation):
\begin{itemize}
  \descitem{Imprecise} Which part of the system? Is this relating to a specific service, or all services?
  \descitem{Subjective} Low, relative to what? Your definition of \quoted{low} may be different from mine.
  \descitem{Unclear} What is meant by \quoted{latency}? Is this the mean of the distribution, the top of the distribution\footnote{Note that this will require \quoted{a lot} of measurements to capture.}, or the 95 percentile?
\end{itemize}

% examples of good requirements
Instead, effort should be made to remove ambiguity\idxx{Ambiguity!Removal}{Ambiguity removal} from the requirements when they are written. The following are examples of requirements\idxx{Requirement!Non-functional!Specification}{Requirement specification} that are easy to deal with in the evaluation:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item \textsl{The upload profile picture service of the system -- as measured on a 130kB picture from the moment the request is issued on the client side to the moment the behavior of other services of the system will reflect resulting state -- must on average complete within 10s.}
  \item \textsl{The time it takes to load and display the front page of the system must in 97\% of all cases be below 5s. This measurement starts when the client initiates the first HTTP GET request, and finishes when the browser has finished layouting.}
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Availability}

% intro: definition
Availability\idx{Availability} is a nebulous term. Surely, it has something to do with the system being available to provide some service. Your system is likely to provide multiple services, and they may not have (or need) equal availability. It might not even be clear what it means for a service to be \quoted{available}. Usually you see a definition over MTBF\idx{MTBF} (mean time between failure) and MTBR\idx{MTBR} (mean time between repair), but it is clearly much more complicated: Certain failures we can accept, and operating on means comes with its own share of problems. Often terms like \quoted{uptime}\idx{Uptime} and \quoted{downtime}\idx{Downtime} are introduced to simplify things. However, these can also have complex definitions. Sometimes a system is said to be \quoted{up} when it responds within a certain period of time. At other times a system is said to be \quoted{down} when the it has not been up for longer than some period of time. In other words, it may be allowed to not be up as long as this is a brief event.

% intro: erlang "9-nines"

% availability-over-time
If you need to provide a high degree of availability\idxx{Availability!Degree of}{Degree of availability} over a significant amount of time you have to consider what kinds of changes can occur across this period of time. Naturally, you will have to update the software in order to react to bugs, feature needs and an changing security landscape. This means that you need to consider what the impact of a software update will have on availability. Over time, protocols and file formats change. How does this affect the availability of the system? Partial hot updates will be key to scoring well here.

% be careful about terms like "high availability"
Requirements on availability should be treated as seriously as any other requirement. Stating that your system \quoted{has high availability}\idx{High availability} provokes the question: High, relative to what? It is not a realistic assumption that we share an interpretation of what that means. If you are not looking to argue specifics, you can get away with a more correct \quoted{provides a high degree of availability}. But for the evaluation you will need to argue \textsl{how} high that degree is.

% brute-force is not an option
\subsubsection{Brute Force Strategy}

% example
\idx{Brute force} Lets assume that it takes $1$s to detect a failure in any part of a system that is critical to availability and restart that part. If you have a requirement of 5-nines, then you can allow one such event to happen every $10^5$s (that's a bit shy of 3 hours). However, that does not mean that we just need to let the system run for 3 hours under load. We haven't gotten to the failure modes and the distributions of failures that fall into the modes yet. Some classes of failures appear more and more frequently as time goes by. In that case you will be much less likely to observe a failure during 3 hours of experimentation on a new system than you would on a 10 year old system.

% problem
To give confidence to a claim\idxx{Claim!Confidence of}{Confidence of claim} of availability you would have to argue that the event is (highly) likely to have happened during the experiment period, and that will end up increasing the length of that period significantly. The failures may also be triggered by certain stimuli\idx{Stimuli}. To trigger the failure mode you would have to produce that stimuli. If you don't know this to be the case, or don't know the specific stimuli, this strategy will require you to spend hours on each potential stimuli. This is time you don't have.

% takeaways
There are two interconnected issues at play here. Firstly, the unit is a whole system. We consider the all of its complexity\idx{Complexity} as a single box, and try to reason about it at that level. As it quickly becomes extremely complicated to reason about such complexity we end up perceiving it as a black box. The second issue is that when dealing with a black box we have to throw statistics at it and for that to make sense we need lots and lots of data.

\subsubsection{Scenario-Based Strategy}

An alternative is to accept at we can't reasonably reach a single hard number that encompasses all aspects of availability in a perfectly balanced way. Instead we can settle for an evaluation that lists a number of (classes of) failure\idx{Failure scenarios} scenarios, and addresses these individually. While these scenarios are clearly relevant en terms of availability, they can also affect other qualities of the system (e.g., performance). Some scenarios can naturally be addressed experimentally, others can be addressed through a solid argument.

As an example, consider a webshop consisting of a frontend, a backend and a DBMS. One failure scenario would be that the DBMS -- for whatever reason -- is restarted. How does the system deal with that? Does it make the system become unavailable, and -- if so -- for how long? How is the responsiveness\idx{Responsiveness} of the system affected? This could be answered as a plot of response time as a function of time after the failure event. What about throughput? Answering these questions will document the behavior of the system after the failure event\idx{Failure event}. The more scenarios you document the more of the availability mechanics is revealed.

% evaluating specific failure modes, and triggering them
\subsubsection{Structural Strategy}

% actors and "which means that it is feasible to unit test for availability"
The actor-model\cite{10.5555/889486}\idx{Actor model} is a software modeling approach that can be seen as a extreme foundation for the scenario-based strategy. Code is split into actors that expose services through a per-actor mailbox. Supervision trees\idx{Supervision tree} can be used to ensure that actors keep running. This -- at least theoretically -- allows us to make per-actor scenarios and unit test for availability. This, of course, requires tooling like what is provided by the Open Telecom Platform\idx{OTP} (OTP) and -- to a lesser degree -- Kubernetes\idx{Kubernetes}.

\section{Data Collection}

\subsection{Automation}

\subsection{Shared Resources}

% problem: shared resources, logging to a disk that the experiment is also using
At the same time, we want the instrumentation\idx{Instrumentation} and logging to be performed as close to the subject as possible (to get more precise information about more things) and as far away as possible (to limit the effect on the subject systems supporting that subject). Computers consist of many systems, and most of these represent shared\idx{Shared resource} resources. If the experimental setup puts a load on a resource that is shared with the subject under experimentation -- or some other system it relies on -- then the performance of the subject is likely to suffer. Relevant shared resources include, but is not limited to, processor, memory and network. For instance, if you are logging to disk, then you take up part of the bandwidth to that disk. From the perspective of the subject, it is running on a disk with degraded performance.

% solution 1: cache in memory until experiment completion
One solution is to cache the logs in memory until the completion of the experiment. That, however, may require a lot of memory, may put a significant strain on the memory bus, and is a risky approach for long-running experiments. See section \ref{sec:eval:collection:longrunning} for general tips on how to deal with long-running experiments.

% solution 2: export over network, unless network is also shared
Another solution is to offload the storage of the logs by streaming them over a network. That, however, shifts the load to the network. If the experiment is independent on the network, then this may be the right solution.

% postscript: which resources can be traded, and how do you ensure the best results?
There is no universally superior solution. There are resources with complex relationships, and each solution incurs a penalty that negatively affects a subset of them. In other words; resources are traded\idx{Tradeoff}, and it is up to you to figure out which solution provides you with the results that best reflects how the system would perform without instrumentation.

\subsection{Long-Running Experiments}
\label{sec:eval:collection:longrunning}

% problem
\idxx{Experiment!Long-running}{Long-running experiments}Some experiments take a long time to run. Whether that is measured in days or weeks, a lot is riding on it. If something were to go wrong, what would the consequences look like? Depending on what went wrong, either the test harness\idx{Test harness} stopped functioning, or it experienced an intermittent period of time where it did not function. As a consequence, every result that were attempted to be produced within this timeframe is either flawed or never came to be in the first case. When this happens we can either repeat the whole thing (wasting time and repeating risk), or -- if we have been continuously storing experimental results to disk -- we can make some adjustments to only repeat those experiments that we are missing viable results from.

% choosing CSV over JSON
However, to even have this ability we need to construct our test harness in a way that continuously writes the data to disk. This cannot be done with a single big JSON\idx{JSON} file. It could be done if you store a single JSON file per test. That, however, could end up resulting in a large number of files that are inconvenient to work with. A better approach is to open a file in \textsl{append\idx{Append mode} mode} and simply append encode all relevant results of a test into a single line. This could be as a JSON object, but that would mean that you would be spending time parsing every single line to get anything out of it. For most cases, CSV\idx{CSV} is flexible enough, faster to work with, and is trivial to parse without tool support.

% flushing to disk: writing to disk is an async operation, buffers at the different levels

% figure: the buffers involved in writing to disk, calls needed to flush

\subsection{Future Proofing}

% intro: evolving experimental framework, evolution across two dimensions (code, and experiments), fields of collected data may change over time, need for the ability to treat different versions of the same file format in the same way.
Over the course of the project, you should expect your experimental framework\idxx{Experimental framework!Evolution of}{Evolution of experimental framework} to evolves, just as your main codebase. Accordingly, the fields collected during an early experiment may not be the same as those being collected in a later experiment. Typically, the set of fields grow over time, but you might realize that you are trading too much and stop collecting certain fields. In order to compare early runs with new runs you will thus need the ability to treat different versions of the same file format in the same way.

% solutions: json, csv (comments in "header")
In a data structure unmarshalled from JSON\idx{JSON} you refer to fields by human recognizable names, but that is not the case for CSV\idx{CSV} files. Here, you refer to fields by index, and that is very easy to mess up if you remove a column. One solution is to introduce a \textsl{header}\idx{Header} as a comment on the first line. While CSV in and of itself does not have a notion of a comment, many software packages for working on them does. Usually using the \quoted{\texttt{\#}} character. In that comment, you place a comma-separated list of strings that can be used to translate from filed names to columns.

% changes in append mode: if appending to the file then the row format can change simply by adding a new header, most recent header defines the format
This approach translates well into a setup where experiment data across multiple runs are appended to a file. Simply add a new header before each experiment (as in figure \ref{fig:eval:collection:future:header:csv}), and make sure you process the header comments as you go through the file. Then the most recent header will always be used to translate the file. An example of how this could be accomplished can be found in appendix \ref{a:eval:collection:future:header:py}. This could trivially be extended to parse cell values into integers and floats.

\section{Presentation}

\subsection{Tabular Data}

% intro: experiment with two factors, what (some quantity that depends on two parameters, numbers that can be placed in a grid), problem
Tabular data fits neatly into a table of two dimensions. That is, some quantity (usually a result) depends on two parameters. This could be the result of an experiment with two factors. The resulting data would fit neatly into a CSV\idx{CSV} file, but could also be stored as JSON\idx{JSON} like that in figure \ref{fig:eval:collection:tabular:json}. This, however, is a very small example. There could be hundreds of cells. How do we document those results in a report? We could perform hundreds of copy-paste operations, but it will take time and the likelihood of us messing it up is quite high. And our motivation\idx{Motivation} will suffer the moment we realize that we have to redo the experiment.

\begin{figure}[tbp]
  \centering
  \inputminted[fontsize=\normalsize]{json}{../var/tabulardata.json}
  \caption{Tabular experimental output in JSON form.}
  \label{fig:eval:collection:tabular:json}
\end{figure}

% proposed process
So, we need to remove the human from the loop. Luckily, with a bit of scripting skill, this is quite easy to automate. We just have to (i) open the file, (ii) unmarshall the JSON structure, (iii) iterate through the cells one row at a time, (iv) produce the \LaTeX\idxx{LaTeX@\LaTeX}{\LaTeX}\ code to represent it, (v) store that code to a file, and (vi) then include that file. And in the process, while we have access to the data, we might as well enrich the representation a bit. In appendix \ref{a:eval:collection:tabular:py} you will find a full Python\idx{Python} script that does this. It finds the minimum and the maximum cell value, and uses this to produce a heatmap\idx{Heatmap} effect by coloring the background of the individual cell. The resulting figure can be seen in figure \ref{fig:eval:collection:tabular:tex}. The code -- and build process -- for producing this result can be found in the GIT repository of this document (see section \ref{sec:source}).

Lets say that your system is supposed to run on 200 nodes, but you only had 10 available for the evaluation. Your results tell you how your design will perform at 10 nodes, but what can you say about what would happen if you kept on adding nodes?

Then you summarize the highlights of your results and arguments in the context of your original problem. This is typically one paragraph, but can also be slip up into a small number of themed paragraphs. Finally, you conclude on the work and the new state of the problem; which parts have you solved, and which parts remain unsolved? How does your \textsl{contribution}\idx{Contribution} fit into the grander scheme of things?

\textbf{Note:} This -- the format of the day -- is being replaced with something else.

% poster day
Every year, SDU hold the \quoted{TEK Software Day}\idx{TEK software day} event sometime in May. Software engineering students who are working on their BSc or MSc present their projects through one poster\idx{Poster} per group, a short pitch, and -- optionally -- a demo. In recent years there has been some variation in the format with regards to whether it is mandatory.

% visitors
Other students and the industry\idx{Industry} in general are encouraged to show up and talk with the presenters. The idea is that the presenters get feedback, the other students get some inspiration about what a BSc/MSc project could look like, and the industry representatives get two things: Insights into what goes on at the university and the ability to scout for future employees.

The poster will have to be handed in as a PDF and will be printed for you. But it is your job to design it. The good presentation contains\idxx{Poster!Anatomy}{Poster anatomy} at least:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Project title, as well as the names and email addresses for each group member and the advisor(s)\footnote{With a clear indicator of the advisor role.}.
  \item An introduction or context part.
  \item A problem statement part.
  \item An approach part.
  \item Some visual overview of the solution.

\begin{enumerate}

  \descitem{Future Work} In which directions would it make sense to take this?\textcolor{teal}{[0-1 slide]}.
  \descitem{Conclusion} Summary of conclusions \textcolor{teal}{[1 slide]}.
\end{enumerate}

% style: don't read aloud from the slides, bulletpoints can work as a starting point, no stock photos (they need to add value), use figures and tables from the report, if you can't find the figures you need in the report chances are that it is missing them
Figures make great partners when you explain something. It allows you to point at the thing you are explaining and functions as visual anchor should you temporarily look the train of thought. Your report should already have most or all of the figures you are going to need. If it doesn't, then you should consider why that is? But sometimes a figure is not the right companion. Bulletpoints or enumerations might be. They allow you to place keywords in your field of vision. Generally speaking, the more hints you can give yourself and the audience the better. However, you shouldn't take this to the extreme: The ability to read a text aloud won't impress censor.

\section{Defense}

\idx{Defense} The allocated time for the defense can be seen in figure \ref{fig:defense:time}\footnote{Please note that this may not be up to date.}\idxx{Defense!Time allocation}{Time allocation}.
% defense sequence: overview, presentation, cycle through group members individually, grade handover at the end
The defense starts with a shared presentation by all group members. This may be followed by a brief series of clarifying questions. At this point the defense shifts from a group setting to an individual setting. When a group member is questioned, any other group members are outside the room. After cycling through all group members, the supervisor and censor will discuss the performances alone and come to a conclusion. The group will be asked to come back into the room again -- either one by one or together -- and the supervisor will present the outcome. This include a listing of good and bad highlights and, naturally, the final grade.

% language:
You are always allowed to conduct the presentation in English. If censor knows Danish, then Danish becomes an option as well. My recommendation is that the slides are written in English either way. The language for the presentation and the language for the following individual defense are not required to be the same. You decide.

% be critical, admit mistakes, explain them, describe what you have learnt and how to avoid it in the future
Few projects go according to plan, and mistakes\idx{Mistakes} are frequently made. There are not problems. Revisiting these situations, figuring out what the problem was and how you could have handled the situation better is actually a positive. It shows that you can be critical of your own work, and learn from your mistakes. As we know everybody makes mistakes. This provides the recipient with insights into how you deal with the.

\subsection{Presentation}

% distribution of time (between group members)
\idxx{Defense!Presentation}{Presentation} When presenting, be sure to distribute the presentation duties roughly evenly across all group members. It doesn't matter too much how large segments each member presents at a time, so try to find a natural balance. In order to not detract from the presentation the changes between speakers should be limited and aligned with natural transitions. Having said that, keeping each segment short allows the next presenter to prepare mentally for his/her lines. However, if no other indication of who did what is available, censor and advisor may try to glen this from the mapping from contents to group member.

% clarifying uncertainties
After the presentation, advisor and censor are likely to have e few questions to clarify uncertainties before progressing to the individual part of the exam.

\subsection{Questions}

% based on learning objectives: clear pass -> verify, middle -> can we pull up? (expectation high), bottom -> can we pull up (expectation low)?, within the given restrictions (e.g., time), => we are going to sample
\idxx{Defense!Questions}{Questions} Some questions will seek to clarify what have been done, and others will address the reasoning behind the choices. In general, we look at the learning objectives. If a learning objective is a clear pass then the goal is to verify that you did the job. If a learning objective is partially fulfilled then the goal is to see if the level of the student is higher than that of the report. The same goes for learning objectives which have not been fulfilled, but here the expectation is low. Because of the time restrictions the questions will represent an attempt to sample enough insights to land on a grade.

% code: may ask about code in report main, highly unlikely to ask about the rest of the code
During the examination we generally try to stay away from code. If there is something in the report main that sticks out it might warrant a follow up, and then it could potentially be taken all the way. In practice, that doesn't happen though.

\subsection{Audience}

% open-door defense (predicated on the lack of an NDA), friends and family, representatives of industry collaborators

\section{Evaluation}

% report perception: report grade, usually +-1 grade, maybe more, potentially+exceptionally all the way down
The report (likely) contains many pages and covers much information. You have spent a significant amount of time on it with few restrictions. Censor and examiner has spent a great deal of time reading it. Compared to that, the defense represents a small amount of time. Coming into the defense, both censor and examiner will have a rough idea of the level of the report, and it is generally -- in the brief time allotted -- hard to sway that perception. Typically, the end results will fall within $\pm 1$ grade step of that initial impression. It does happen that the final grade is shifted more, but it is rare. In exceptional cases (e.g., if it is discovered that someone hasn't participated), the grade could potentially go all the way down.

\section{Industry}

% the industrial partner? what have you learnt?

% keep in touch

\section{Academia}

% next step: the phd

% stay abroad

% industrial phd: problem root, often significant backing, heavy influence of industrial interests (potential conflicts on publications), no duty hours to university, hired by industry

\subsection{Motivation}

\idx{Motivation}Usually, the motivation for taking a PhD is a combination of:
\begin{itemize}
  \descitem{Career in academia} You want to go into academia, and that ties your hands.
  \descitem{Interesting project} You see a project that speaks to you, and this is the opportunity to spend real time digging into it.
  \descitem{Industry job type} You have an expectation that with a PhD you will get a more interesting job in the industry.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{PhD Models}

There are two models for doing PhD's at SDU:
\begin{enumerate}
  \descitem{5+3 Programme} Your ticket into this program is an MSc degree. After enrollment, you spend 3 years doing research and are (if successful) awarded a PhD degree. This is by far the most common model.
  \descitem{4+4 Programme}\footnote{\url{https://www.sdu.dk/en/forskning/phd/phd_skoler/phdtek/phdstudietsforloebindhold/44_masters_study}} You enter this program when you are halfway through your MSc education. That is, you are 60 ECTS away from your degree. Halfway into your PhD, you must pass a master's exam. The MSc project should be strongly connected to the PhD. You will end up spending 4 years doing research.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Funding}

% bring your own funding: this is rare

% advisor applies for funding: advisor decides the area

% collaborative application: may not go through, best candidate wins

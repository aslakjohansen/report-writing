\section{State Machines}

% state machines are graphs: nodes as states, edges as possible transitions, each edge is annotated with the set of inputs/events that will trigger a transition, no input/event can be present at more than one outgoing edge on any given node

% mechanics: sequence of inputs/events (either static or dynamic), the system is always in a state, For each consumed input the system transitions to a different state (which might be the same as the previous), some processing may be involved.

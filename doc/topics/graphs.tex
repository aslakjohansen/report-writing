\section{Graphs}

A graph\idx{Graph} is a structure that can be used to model how things relate to each other. Graphs consists of nodes\idx{Node} (also called vertices) and edges\idx{Edge} between them. There are many variations over the theme, but the most basic one is the \textsl{undirected}\idxx{Graph!Undirected}{Undirected} graph. It can be defined as:
\begin{eqnarray*}
  G = (N,E)
\end{eqnarray*}
Here, $N$ is the set of nodes and $E$ is the set of edges. We often choose to illustrate nodes as circles or boxes, and edges as lines.

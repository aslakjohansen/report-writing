\section{Graphs}

A graph\idx{Graph} is a structure that can be used to model how things relate to each other. Graphs consists of nodes\idx{Node} (also called vertices) and edges\idx{Edge} between them. There are many variations over the theme, but the most basic one is the \textsl{undirected}\idxx{Graph!Undirected}{Undirected} graph. It can be defined as:
\begin{eqnarray*}
  G = (N,E)
\end{eqnarray*}
Here, $N$ is the set of nodes and $E$ is the set of edges. We often choose to illustrate nodes as circles or boxes, and edges as lines.

\subsection{Directed Acyclic Graphs}

Directed acyclic graphs\idx{DAG}, or DAGs, are directed graphs without cycles. For algorithmic reasons, this is a very attractive quality in a graph.

\subsection{Trees}

% basics
A tree\idx{Tree} is a graph where any pair of nodes are connected by exactly one path. Technically, trees, are undirected graphs. However, most real-world examples are directed graphs where a \textsl{root}\idxx{Tree!Root node}{Root node} node is anchoring the tree. From this node a single path leads to each of the other nodes. These are either called \textsl{leaf}\idxx{Tree!Leaf node}{Leaf node} nodes -- if they have no outgoing edges -- or \textsl{branch}\idxx{Tree!Branch node}{Branch node} nodes. These are typically drawn with the root at the top and leaves at the bottom. That is, growing downwards as shown in figure \ref{fig:topics:graphs:example:tree}. But sometimes, for practical reasons, they are drawn growing towards the right.

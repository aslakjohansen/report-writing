\section{Versioning Control Systems}

% what

% git focus: there are many cvs's, git is part of a "new" generation and by far the most popular of those, unless you have a good reason you should use git for every new project
Over the years, there has been many versioning control systems in use. CVS\idx{CVS} has critical issues and should absolutely not be used today. It was superceded by subversion\idx{Subversion} (SVN) that fixed all those issues. After subversion came a new generation of \textsl{distributed} versionsing control systems (e.g., GIT, mercurial\idx{Mercurial} and monotone\idx{Monotone}). Among these, GIT\idx{GIT} is by far the most popular one. Unless you have a really good reason you should use GIT for every new project. And for that reason, GIT is what is being covered here.

\subsection{Supervision Trees}

% failures, sandbox, crashes, monitoring
Actors, like any other construct of logic, can fail for reasons ranging from common (e.g., a bug) to exotic (e.g., random bitflips\idx{Bitflip}). To deal with this actors should operate within some sort of sandbox\idx{Sandbox}. Still, crashes\idx{Crash} will occur and, when that happens, a part of the logic will go away. This raises to need for monitoring\idx{Monitoring} actors, detecting their crashes and action on them by starting up a replacement actor.

% supervisor role: what to do when there is a crash? need for a component to handle this event, lifecycle management (starting, stopping, dependency aware)
